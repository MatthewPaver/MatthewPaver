# Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and notebooks exploring foundational topics in data analysis, machine learning, and numerical computation. Each file serves a specific purpose in the learning journey, from mathematical preliminaries to implementing classification algorithms.

## üìÅ Files Overview

### 1. `numpy,_matplotlib,_and_math_preliminaries.py`
This script introduces core mathematical operations using NumPy and Matplotlib. Topics covered include:
- Vector and matrix operations (addition, dot product, outer product)
- Matrix properties like rank and inverse
- Eigenvalue and eigenvector computation
- Gradient descent visualisation for function minimisation

### 2. `Missing_values,_normalisation,_classifier_evaluation.ipynb`
This Jupyter notebook focuses on:
- Handling missing values in datasets
- Data normalization techniques
- Evaluating classifiers using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix
- Practical experimentation using real-world data to reinforce preprocessing steps and model evaluation

### 3. `classification_algorithms.py`
This Python script walks through:
- Generating synthetic 2D data for binary classification
- Implementing a custom k-NN classifier using cosine similarity
- Splitting datasets into training and validation sets
- Evaluating model performance with accuracy plots
- Experimenting with different `k` values and dataset parameters to understand classification boundaries

## üìö Purpose
These exercises are designed to reinforce key concepts in data science and machine learning through hands-on Python programming. Ideal for students and beginners aiming to build strong foundations.
