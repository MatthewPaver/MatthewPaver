# Lab 1 - Autonomous Mobile Robotics

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to introduce students to the basics of autonomous mobile robotics, including robot control, sensor integration, and basic navigation.

## Implementation
The implementation involves:
1. Setting up the Webots simulation environment.
2. Writing a controller script to move the robot forward.
3. Integrating sensors to detect obstacles and adjust the robot's path.
4. Visualizing the robot's movement and sensor data.

## Usage
To run the simulation, follow these steps:
1. Open Webots and load the `my_first_simulation.wbt` world file.
2. Compile and run the `my_controller.py` script.
3. Observe the robot's behavior and make adjustments as needed.
