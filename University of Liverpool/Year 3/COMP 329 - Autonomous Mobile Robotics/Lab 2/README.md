# Lab 2 - Autonomous Mobile Robotics

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to further explore autonomous mobile robotics by implementing more advanced navigation and mapping techniques.

## Implementation
The implementation involves:
1. Setting up the Webots simulation environment.
2. Writing a controller script to navigate the robot through a predefined path.
3. Integrating sensors to detect obstacles and adjust the robot's path.
4. Implementing SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to create a map of the environment.
5. Visualizing the robot's movement and sensor data.

## Usage
To run the simulation, follow these steps:
1. Open Webots and load the `2nd_lab.wbt` world file.
2. Compile and run the `drive_controller.py` script.
3. Observe the robot's behavior and make adjustments as needed.
