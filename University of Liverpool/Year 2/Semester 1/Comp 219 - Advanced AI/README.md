# README for: Adversarial Attack and Resilience to Adversarial Attack

## Introduction
This README accompanies Assignment 2, which focuses on enhancing the resilience of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. Building on the concepts and techniques explored in Assignment 1, this assignment delves into strategies for fortifying models to withstand such attacks effectively.

## Assignment Overview
The primary objective of this assignment is to implement and evaluate methods that improve a machine learning model's ability to resist adversarial examples. Students are expected to apply their knowledge from Appendix D of the "Machine Learning Safety" textbook and insights gained from Assignment 1 to develop robust defense mechanisms.

## Key Instructions
1. **Consult Appendix D**: Begin by revisiting Appendix D in the "Machine Learning Safety" textbook, paying particular attention to sections related to model defense and resilience.
2. **Reference the Assignment Briefing Page**: Additional details and guidance specific to this assignment can be found on the Assignment Briefing page. It is crucial to review this resource to fully understand the scope and requirements of the task.
3. **Adhere to Detailed Instructions**: Your submission must closely follow the directives outlined in sections D.1, D.3, and D.3.1 of Appendix D, which cover submission procedures, source code expectations, and the implementation process.
4. **Implement Defense Strategies**: Drawing from both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, implement one or more defense strategies aimed at enhancing the model's resilience to adversarial attacks. Consider approaches such as adversarial training, input transformation, or model regularization.
5. **Document Your Approach**: Provide comprehensive documentation that outlines your defense strategies, including the rationale behind your choices, the implementation process, and any challenges encountered.
6. **Evaluate Model Robustness**: Conduct a thorough evaluation of the model's performance in the face of adversarial examples, both before and after applying your defense mechanisms. Present your findings using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
7. **Reflect on Your Findings**: Discuss the effectiveness of the implemented defense strategies and their potential impact on the model's overall performance. Consider the trade-offs involved and explore avenues for further improvement.

## Submission Guidelines
- Ensure that your submission package includes all relevant source code, documentation, and supplementary materials.
- Your code should be well-commented, organized, and adherent to best practices for readability and maintainability.
- Follow the submission instructions provided by the course, including adherence to specified file formats, naming conventions, and submission deadlines.

## Conclusion
This assignment challenges you to apply and extend your understanding of adversarial attacks and model resilience in a practical setting. By successfully completing this assignment, you will gain valuable skills in developing more secure and robust machine learning systems, a critical competency in the field of AI safety.
