# COMP201: Software Engineering I - Assignment 1.1 (2023/2024)

## Objective
This assignment focuses on "Requirements Engineering" and involves producing parts of a requirements document for a "proposed building security system". The primary goal is to analyze, generate, and document user requirements based on the given scenario.

## Details
- **Assignment Number:** 1 of 2
- **Weighting:** 15% of COMP201 grade
- **Circulation Date:** 25th September 2023
- **Deadline:** 14th November 2023, 17:00
- **Submission Mode:** Electronic submission on Canvas (PDF)
- **Learning Outcomes:**
  1. Understand the challenges in designing and building significant computer systems.
  2. Recognize the importance of designing systems that meet user requirements fully.
  3. Apply these principles in practice.

## Task Overview
### Task 1 (80%)
- Develop a UML use-case model for the proposed building security system, including both a use-case diagram and use-case descriptions.
- Identify as many actors as possible within the system's scope.

### Task 2 (20%)
- List 10 non-functional requirements for the proposed building security system, ensuring each requirement has a verifiable criterion.

## Proposed System Overview
The system is designed for a bank to protect buildings against robbery, theft, and fire, incorporating various sensors, buttons, and outputs.

## Marking Criteria
- Correct use of notation and well-chosen set of use cases for grades A++ to A (70%+).
- A good set of use cases but with some descriptions missing or minor issues for grades B (60%-69%).
- For further details, see the marking criteria section in the assignment document.

## Notes
- Make reasonable assumptions without inventing new functionality.
- Different solutions can be equally good; there's no single "right answer" to system modeling.
- Refer to course textbooks "Software Engineering" by I. Sommerville and "Using UML" by P. Stevens for additional guidance.

Please refer to the full assignment document for a detailed description of tasks and requirements.
