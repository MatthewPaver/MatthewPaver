## Assignment 2 - Card Game - Poker Style

### Overview
This C++ GUI card game, developed with Qt, mimics a poker experience where the player competes against a computer opponent using a standard 52-card deck. The game employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and uses royalty-free images to visually represent the cards. Players aim to form the highest value hand from combinations of 5 cards to win rounds against the computer, following poker-like rules and hand rankings.
