# Minimum-Value Grouping Function

## Overview
The `min_value_grouping` function is a Python program designed to solve the Minimum-Value Grouping Problem. It groups a sequence of positive integers into a specified number of groups to minimize the total sum of the values of each group.

## Problem Description
Given a sequence of `n` positive integers and a positive integer `k` (where `k` â‰¤ `n`), the task is to "group" these numbers into `k` groups of consecutive numbers in the input order, so as to minimize the total sum of the values of each group. The value of a group `G_j` is the cube of the sum of its elements.

The goal is to find such a grouping so that the objective function is minimized, which is the sum of the values of all `k` groups.

## Dynamic Programming Approach
The solution implements a dynamic programming approach, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum value for the first `i` numbers grouped into `j` groups. A cumulative sum array is used for efficient calculation of group sums.

## Time and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: `O(kn^2)`, due to three nested loops iterating up to `k`, `n`, and `n`.
- Space Complexity: `O(nk)`, for the dynamic programming table and cumulative sum array.

## Input Format
The input consists of three lines:
- The first line contains the value of `n`, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains the value of `k`, the number of groups to divide the array into.
- The third line contains the sequence of `n` integers separated by a whitespace.

## Output Format
The output consists of two lines:
- The first line contains a single integer that is the optimal value of the objective function.
- The second line contains a list that contains the cutting points, including `0` and `n`.

## How to Use
To execute the function, simply run the script and provide the input in the format specified above when prompted.
