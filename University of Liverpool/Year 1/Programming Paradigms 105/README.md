# Haskell Assignments Overview

This repository contains a series of Haskell assignments to explore functional programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques in Haskell.

## Files Description

- **Assignment1.hs:** This file contains the solutions to the first set of problems, focusing on basic functional programming concepts and simple data manipulations.
- **Checker.hs:** A utility script used to check the correctness of solutions provided in the other files. It includes test cases and validation functions within assignment 1.
- **Assignment2.hs:** In this file, you will find solutions to more advanced problems, including using higher-order functions, list comprehensions, and custom data types.
- **Assignment3.hs:** This assignment delves deeper into complex problem-solving involving recursion, pattern matching, and more sophisticated systems.

## How to Run the Code

To run any of these Haskell files, you will need to have the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Haskell files.
3. Use the GHC to compile and run the desired file. For example, to run `Assignment1.hs`, you would use the following command:
   ```bash
   ghc Assignment1.hs -o Assignment1
   ./Assignment1
