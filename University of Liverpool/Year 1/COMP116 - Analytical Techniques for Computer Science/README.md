# COMP116 - Analytical Techniques for Computer Science

PDF slides in this folder introduce the mathematical foundations required for Computer Science:

- Numbers and number types, vectors and vector spaces
- Calculus topics such as derivatives, integrals and critical points
- Complex numbers and linear transformations
- Applications including PageRank, image compression and regression

These notes provide the background for later modules that rely on mathematics.
