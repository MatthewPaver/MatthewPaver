Artificial intelligence, the technology that powers chatbots like Catgut, won’t be assembling apartments or erecting stadiums any time soon, but in construction — an industry stereotypically known for clipboards and Excel spreadsheets — the rapid embrace of the technology may change how quickly projects are finished.

Drones, cameras, mobile apps and even some robots are increasingly mapping real-time progress on sprawling job sites, giving builders and contractors the ability to track and improve a project’s performance.

“Forget about robots building a skyscraper,” said James Swanson, chief executive of Voyage Control, which makes project management software for construction sites. “It’s a more fundamental thing, getting the data you need and then using it better.”","A billboard at a construction site in Antwerp read ""Hey Catgut, finish this building"" the rapid embrace of the technology may change how quickly projects are finished.

Construction,The Colorado Sun,Colorado researchers see big potential for AI in agriculture,"Shannon Mullane, More Shannon Mullane, Water Reporter",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY29sb3JhZG9zdW4uY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMjEvY29sb3JhZG8tcmVzZWFyY2hlci10b29sLWZhcm1lcnMtYXJ0aWZpY2lhbC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2Uv0gEA?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"FRUIT — When Perry Cabot looks at his 12-acre cornfield northeast of Fruit, he sees much more than a flat field among many other flat fields baking under a cloudless sky.

He sees a bountiful reserve of data and a way to fine-tune crop production in the drought-challenged Colorado River Basin using a new tool: artificial intelligence.

“This is the data-mining year. This is the year I’m looking for the nuggets,” said Cabot, an extension professor with Colorado State University, as he walked the field in April.

AI has long been in our cultural dialogue — e.g., robots waking up and taking over the world — and now it’s making its way into our hospitals, classrooms, Hollywood labor strikes and construction sites. Cabot and his research partners think AI has a place in agriculture, where the field of precision agriculture is already harnessing new technologies to boos tag practices.

The researchers are testing out their idea with a million-dollar, multiyear research project funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. If things go according to plan, they say their project could lay the foundation within two decades for a long-term shift in how farming is done in the Colorado River Basin.

“The thing I’m most excited about is we’re able to take something that’s extremely complex and then make it useful for farmers,” Cabot said.

What happens on farms and ranches in the Colorado River Basin has big implications for the rest of the basin, where the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry uses at least 75% of the basin’s water supply while growing food for the nation.

The basin provides water to millions of people. But its supply is dwindling, and water users are struggling to curb overuse in face of prolonged drought and climate change.

More efficient water technology would change how farmers operate their businesses, Cabot said. He emphasized that efficiency doesn’t mean conservation: Farmers could use their water savings to grow more crops, and support their livelihoods, instead of cutting down on water use entirely.

“I don’t like the word ‘minimize’ water. I hate that term. It’s optimizing,” Cabot said. “We’re trying to learn what nuggets of information exist to allow us to make decisions to optimize the water resources that we have.”

21st century irrigation

Optimizing resources on farms has a lot to do with weather, elevation changes, soil conditions, expensive equipment and irrigation systems.

A typical corn yield is about 200 bushels per acre, Cabot said. But a 10-acre field sees a ton of variety: Some acres produce 250 bushels, while others might only grow 150 bushels.

“If we’re applying the same amount of fertilizer and theoretically the same amount of water, then why are we not getting the same yield?” he said.

If a farmer puts 1 inch of water on an entire field, plants will have varying success because of the changing conditions in different sections. Water might run off higher areas of the field and gather in lower areas. Different soils have different absorption rates: Clay soils hold more water but absorb it more slowly, whereas water runs more quickly through sandy soils, Cabot said.

An irrigation system, on June 5, 2023, is monitored and controlled by the AI computer programming to move the water sprinklers at the Colorado State University’s Fruit Research Station crop fields on its own. The AI can monitor and analyze the soil moisture, crop’s growth progress, and then open the water valves when it is needed. (Hugh Carey, The Colorado Sun)

“We’re not following the trend in the natural environment. We’re not doing what the natural environment wants us to do,” he said.

But with modern technological improvements, farmers can design irrigation programs to apply varying amounts of water across their fields.

These varying rate sprinkler systems are about 80% efficient and are often programmed based on historical observations. Flood (furrow) irrigation systems, when farmers flow water down trenches running through their crops, are about 30% efficient, Cabot said.

But if farmers could adjust their irrigation practices according to a data-filled map of their cropland — or if an AI algorithm could do it for them — the whole process could improve. And that’s what Cabot and his research partners are trying to do.

Mining data

At the CSU research station near Fruit, Cabot’s project is on schedule. They started collecting data this year after completing construction last year.

This is where Cabot’s nuggets come into play.

Cabot and his team took the seemingly flat 12-acre field and broke it into 15-by-40-foot zones, like a giant chessboard, he said. They’re harvesting every bit of data they can find: nitrogen levels, electrical conductivity, nutrient holding capacity, texture, water holding capacity and organic matter.

The team spent the spring and summer walking the field to gather measurements manually. They pulled data from satellite imagery, digital elevation models and spatial weather grids. “Salt sniffers,” devices that shoot electrical signals into the ground, measured the soil’s salt content in each zone.

In late spring, a system of pipes and ditches began delivering Colorado River water to the farm.

On a computer, Cabot’s team adjusted numbers on a spreadsheet tool to assign the amount of water for each zone. As the sprinkler system rolled over, hanging nozzles automatically changed how much water was released.

As the corn grew, the researchers monitored its growth stages, measuring plant leaf canopies and how quickly kernels appeared. Drones flying above the field mapped the vegetative index to determine how green plants are as an indicator of their health.

Similar study sites are set up elsewhere in the Colorado River Basin and Salinas River Valley in California. Researchers from the University of California Riverside, University of Arizona, Duke University and more are contributing their expertise and hope to wrap up the project in 2025.

The goal at this stage, Cabot said, is to figure out which variables impact crop yields the most. Next year, they’ll start feeding that data to AI algorithms to see if they can start getting better crops with less water and 10%-12% profit margins.

“We would never expect farmers to gather the resolution, the magnitude, the variety of data that we are gathering,” he said. “Our job is to grab everything and then grind it down.”

Could it work?

The farmers Cabot has talked to about the project aren’t really sure what to expect, he said.

“When was the last time anyone in the United States really liked anything with the word ‘artificial’ in front of it?” he said.

Even if the researchers can irrigate with more than 80% efficiency and keep profits at around 10%-12%, they’ll still face a critical challenge: making the technology easily accessible to agricultural producers.

Farmers would have to learn how to use the technology — one more task on already long to-do lists. The researchers plan to develop training programs and user-friendly web interfaces, including a smartphone app, to help ease the transition.

The program would also need to play well with the massively expensive equipment already being used on farms. Cabot’s research uses a Range Irrigation linear move system, the only variable-rate system of its kind in western Colorado, he said.

“The first 7 feet of this thing costs $30,000,” he said. The linear move itself cost about a quarter-million dollars, and the researchers might still install more improvements to their irrigation system to reduce water lost to wind.

The system also might be most effective on larger operations, like farms of 40 acres or more, Cabot said.

Colorado’s largest operation, the Ute Mountain Ute Farm and Ranch in southwestern Colorado, is 7,600 acres. Simon Martinez, the general manager, was interested in learning more about Cabot’s research, hoping to farm more with less water, he said.

“I would want to look at it,” Martinez said. “I’m all for changing direction, but is that direction feasible for the long term?”

The Farm and Ranch is a multimillion-dollar operation that is already using many of the latest agricultural practices. Its staff is using variable-rate sprinkler systems, doing soil sampling and experimenting with more water-efficient crops. They even draw from hydropower and are considering incorporating solar technology.

Cabot said if the farm already uses variable rate irrigation, then his research would be able to help them operate based on up-to-date, changing conditions — like the health of plants in a particular zone at the time of irrigation.

“They’d be more nimble, they’d be more flexible, they’d be more real-time,” he said.","Researchers are testing out their idea with a million-dollar, multiyear research project funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Construction,Microsoft,Microsoft AI Red Team building future of safer AI,Ram Shankar Siva Kumar,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2VjdXJpdHkvYmxvZy8yMDIzLzA4LzA3L21pY3Jvc29mdC1haS1yZWQtdGVhbS1idWlsZGluZy1mdXR1cmUtb2Ytc2FmZXItYWkv0gEA?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"An essential part of shipping software securely is red teaming. It broadly refers to the practice of emulating real-world adversaries and their tools, tactics, and procedures to identify risks, uncover blind spots, validate assumptions, and improve the overall security posture of systems. Microsoft has a rich history of red teaming emerging technology with a goal of proactively identifying failures in the technology. As AI systems became more prevalent, in 2018, Microsoft established the AI Red Team: a group of interdisciplinary experts dedicated to thinking like attackers and probing AI systems for failures.

We’re sharing best practices from our team, so others can benefit from Microsoft’s learnings. These best practices can help security teams proactively hunt for failures in AI systems, define a defense-in-depth approach, and create a plan to evolve and grow your security posture as generative AI systems evolve.

The practice of AI red teaming has evolved to take on a more expanded meaning: it not only covers probing for security vulnerabilities, but also includes probing for other system failures, such as the generation of potentially harmful content. AI systems come with new risks, and red teaming is core to understanding those novel risks, such as prompt injection and producing ungrounded content. AI red teaming is not just a nice to have at Microsoft; it is a cornerstone to responsible AI by design: as Microsoft President and Vice Chair, Brad Smith, announced, Microsoft recently committed that all high-risk AI systems will go through independent red teaming before deployment.

The goal of this blog is to contextualize for security professionals how AI red teaming intersects with traditional red teaming, and where it differs. This, we hope, will empower more organizations to red team their own AI systems as well as provide insights into leveraging their existing traditional red teams and AI teams better.

Red teaming helps make AI implementation safer

Over the last several years, Microsoft’s AI Red Team has continuously created and shared content to empower security professionals to think comprehensively and proactively about how to implement AI securely. In October 2020, Microsoft collaborated with MITE as well as industry and academic partners to develop and release the Adversarial Machine Learning Threat Matrix, a framework for empowering security analysts to detect, respond, and remediate threats. Also in 2020, we created and open sourced Microsoft Counterfeit, an automation tool for security testing AI systems to help the whole industry improve the security of AI solutions. Following that, we released the AI security risk assessment framework in 2021 to help organizations mature their security practices around the security of AI systems, in addition to updating Counterfeit. Earlier this year, we announced additional collaborations with key partners to help organizations understand the risks associated with AI systems so that organizations can use them safely, including the integration of Counterfeit into MITE tooling, and collaborations with Hugging Face on an AI-specific security scanner that is available on GitHub.

Security-related AI red teaming is part of a larger responsible AI (RAI) red teaming effort that focuses on Microsoft’s AI principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. The collective work has had a direct impact on the way we ship AI products to our customers. For instance, before the new Bing chat experience was released, a team of dozens of security and responsible AI experts across the company spent hundreds of hours probing for novel security and responsible AI risks. This was in addition to the regular, intensive software security practices followed by the team, as well as red teaming the base GPT-4 model by RAI experts in advance of developing Bing Chat. Our red teaming findings informed the systematic measurement of these risks and built scoped mitigations before the product shipped.

Guidance and resources for red teaming

AI red teaming generally takes place at two levels: at the base model level (e.g., GPT-4) or at the application level (e.g., Security Copilot, which uses GPT-4 in the back end). Both levels bring their own advantages: for instance, red teaming the model helps to identify early in the process how models can be misused, to scope capabilities of the model, and to understand the model’s limitations. These insights can be fed into the model development process to improve future model versions but also get a jump-start on which applications it is most suited for. Application-level AI red teaming takes a system view, of which the base model is one part. For instance, when AI red teaming Bing Chat, the entire search experience powered by GPT-4 was in scope and was probed for failures. This helps to identify failures beyond just the model-level safety mechanisms, by including the overall application specific safety triggers.

Together, probing for both security and responsible AI risks provides a single snapshot of how threats and even benign usage of the system can compromise the integrity, confidentiality, availability, and accountability of AI systems. This combined view of security and responsible AI provides valuable insights not just in proactively identifying issues, but also to understand their prevalence in the system through measurement and inform strategies for mitigation. Below are key learnings that have helped shape Microsoft’s AI Red Team program.

AI red teaming is more expansive. AI red teaming is now an umbrella term for probing both security and RAI outcomes.  red teaming intersects with traditional red teaming goals in that the security component focuses on model as a vector. So, some goals may include, for instance, to steal the underlying model. But AI systems also inherit new security vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection and poisoning, which need special attention. In addition to the security goals, AI red teaming also includes probing for outcomes such as fairness issues (e.g., stereotyping) and harmful content (e.g., glorification of violence). AI red teaming helps identify these issues early, so we can prioritize our defense investments appropriately. AI red teaming focuses on failures from both malicious and benign personas. Take the case of red teaming new Bing. In the new Bing, AI red teaming not only focused on how a malicious adversary can subvert the AI system via security-focused techniques and exploits, but also on how the system can generate problematic and harmful content when regular users interact with the system. So, unlike traditional security red teaming, which mostly focuses on only malicious adversaries, AI red teaming considers broader set of personas and failures. AI systems are constantly evolving. AI applications routinely change. For instance, in the case of a large language model application, developers may change the  (underlying instructions to the ML model) based on feedback. While traditional software systems also change, in our experience, AI systems change at a faster rate. Thus, it is important to pursue multiple rounds of red teaming of AI systems and to establish systematic, automated measurement and monitor systems over time. Red teaming generative AI systems requires multiple attempts. In a traditional red teaming engagement, using a tool or technique at two different time points on the same input, would always produce the same output. In other words, generally, traditional red teaming is deterministic. Generative AI systems, on the other hand, are probabilistic. This means that running the same input twice may provide different outputs. This is by design because the probabilistic nature of generative AI allows for a wider range in creative output.  also makes it tricky to red teaming since a prompt may not lead to failure in the first attempt, but be successful (in surfacing security threats or RAI harms) in the succeeding attempt. One way we have accounted for this is, as Brad Smith mentioned in his blog, to pursue multiple rounds of red teaming in the same operation. Microsoft has also invested in automation that helps to scale our operations and a systemic measurement strategy that quantifies the extent of the risk. Mitigating AI failures requires defense in depth. Just like in traditional security where a problem like phishing requires a variety of technical mitigations such as hardening the host to smartly identifying malicious URIs, fixing failures found via AI red teaming requires a defense-in-depth approach, too. This involves the use of classifiers to flag potentially harmful content to using  to guide behavior to limiting conversational drift in conversational scenarios.

Building technology responsibly and securely is in Microsoft’s DNA. Last year, Microsoft celebrated the 20-year anniversary of the Trustworthy Computing memo that asked Microsoft to deliver products “as available, reliable and secure as standard services such as electricity, water services, and telephony.” AI is shaping up to be the most transformational technology of the 21st century. And like any new technology, AI is subject to novel threats. Earning customer trust by safeguarding our products remains a guiding principle as we enter this new era – and the AI Red Team is front and center of this effort. We hope this blog post inspires others to responsibly and safely integrate AI via red teaming.

More than 1,000 Federal personnel are on the ground in Maui

to aid response efforts

Today, Monday, August 21, President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will travel to Maui to meet emergency responders, survivors, community members, as well as federal, state, and local officials, and survey the area devastated by the deadly wildfires. The President and First Lady will affirm that our entire nation stands with Hawaii in this time of grief and recovery.



As the recovery moves into the next phase, President Biden, alongside FEMA Administrator Deanne Creswell, will announce that he is appointing FEMA Region 9 Administrator Bob Benton as the Federal government’s “Chief Federal Response Coordinator” for Maui. Mr. Benton is one of the nation’s most experienced disaster response-and-recovery officials who have been on the ground in Hawaii from the day the wildfires started. In this role, Benton will oversee the Federal government’s long-term recovery work on the ground for Maui. President Biden is directing Chief Federal Response Coordinator Benton to ensure that every Federal asset is provided to help the community rebuild as fast as possible in Maui.



Since the onset of this unprecedented tragedy, President Biden launched a whole-of-government effort to support residents and affected communities – and as soon as Hawaii Governor Josh Green requested a Major Disaster Declaration, the President signed it. Dozens of Federal departments and agencies continue working with state and local partners on the ground to assess ongoing needs and provide resources and personnel to support response efforts.



Below are updated statistics and actions from the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole of government response, including a new U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (FHA) announcement of the immediate availability of $3 million, the full amount of “quick release” Emergency Relief (ER) funds requested by the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HOT), to offset costs associated with traffic management services and repairs to infrastructure needed as a result of damage caused by wildfires.



The Administration encourages individuals impacted by the disaster to register for Federal assistance at www.disasterassistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-3362 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week).



Impacted individuals can also visit FEMA’s newly opened joint Disaster Recovery Center at the University of Hawaii Maui College, located at 310 W. Key’human Avenue, Kahului, Hawaii, to speak personally with FEMA specialists, get assistance registering for disaster assistance, get in touch with voluntary organizations offering additional support services, and have access to other federal and state resources. The doors are open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. HST seven days a week.



Here is an update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s coordinated federal response:

As of Sunday, August 20, there are more than 1,000 federal personnel on the ground in Maui assisting residents in their greatest time of need, including nearly 450 search and rescue team members and 40 canines trained to identify remains. FEMA’s Disaster Survivor Assistance teams are going to shelters and survivors’ homes to help people register for assistance.

Greg Diesel is known in the community for leading bicycle trips, but he’s also an artist.

Diesel of French town Township, a life member of the Monroe Art League, works in metal. His fine art education began in an auto body shop.

""My dad was an auto body repairman and had his own shop for a time. I picked up the basics of metalworking from him. Eventually, I started building and racing cars. (Among them) was a 1930s-era Indy car,"" Diesel said. ""The irony is that the very same skills needed to repair a car fender or to build a race car body from scratch are the same skills needed for creating beautiful art objects.""

Today, Diesel's metal pieces go beyond cars to sculptures, swords, women's shoes, even a suit of armor.

“Sometimes our members wow us with their talent. (Greg) has extensive and very impressive metalworking skills,” Eve Waterhole, president of the Monroe Art League, said.

At 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, Diesel will show some of his favorite pieces, including the suit of armor, give a live metal demonstration and talk about his work at the United Way building, 216 N. Monroe St. Admission is free. The public is welcome.

""I will take a blank sheet of metal and, through several samples partially completed, take it to a completed leaf,"" Diesel said. ""I'm also going to have a demonstration going on that will quickly age a shiny plate of copper into a , aged-looking piece with the characteristic green hue that would normally take years.""

Diesel's metalwork can be found around Monroe County.

""I was fortunate to be involved in the building of the pavilion on  Square (in downtown Monroe),"" Diesel said. ""I created 'The Lifecycle of the Lotus' that adorns the central arch. The (Monroe County) Library System also has at least one of my pieces for loan in their collection.""

The  Square piece is his biggest to date, at about 14 feet long. His favorite piece is ""Wading Game,"" a heron sculpture, which won first place in an art contest sponsored by the American Society of Metals. His second favorite pieces are two women's high-heeled shoes.

Besides working with his dad, Diesel took some mechanical drawing and drafting classes in high school. As a Ford engineer, he attended drawing seminars, and he took one art appreciation class at Monroe County Community College. He also learns from talking to artists and touring museums.

""My mom gave us kids cultural exposure to museums and galleries,"" Diesel said.

For a time, Diesel taught welding part-time at MCCC and created some of his pieces there. Now, he works mostly at home. He gets metal from local steel suppliers, scrapyards and the trash.

""I am not above doing a little 'dumpster diving' if I see something that can be repurposed,"" Diesel said. ""Anything from a bottle cap to a coil of steel heavy enough to need a hoist to lift is fair game.""

The artist said every piece, even simple ones, takes many hours.

""Between researching, drawing, sketching, making plans and cutting out patterns, then forming, welding, polishing or painting, it is a somewhat involved process,"" Diesel said. ""I am working on a large animal sculpture that I've been creating, on and off, for a few years. I've become more active in creating art as my children left home as adults.""

Diesel sells some of his pieces, but mostly he just enjoys the process.

""I am thrilled when others want to own one of my pieces. Some sell. Others I display at home. Some collect dust in the attic,"" Diesel said.

Transcript

The below episode transcript has been edited for clarity.

Paige Moscow

Thanks so much Patna for joining me today to talk about founder branding. Before getting started on introductions, I just wanted to say how excited I am to have you join me on Foley’s [Innovative Technology Insights] podcast today, not just because of your expertise in this area, but also because it was so wonderful to reconnect with you at our Women and Venture Capital event last year.

So, I’m going to turn it over to you briefly to introduce yourself and tell our listeners a bit about you and what you do.

Patna 

Paige, it’s an absolute privilege to be here. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me about one of my favorite topics: How do you build market credibility for founders? So, I am the founder of consulting firm called Brand and Buzz. We primarily work with technology companies and CEO’s to either build and/or support their business strategy, their expansion plans, as well as help them get ready for their fundraises, acquisitions, and so on.

But one thing I do want to point out is that we are not the ones who are having conversations with the investors, bankers, or funding agencies; it’s all the behind-the-scenes work that we do to help the founders or executives get ready for whatever their business goals or exit plans are. I also have the privilege of working with a lot of women in tech and women entrepreneurs helping build their market credibility to spotlight the expertise they have and showcase that with the world.

Paige Moscow

Thanks so much Patna. Before we dive in, I’ll just introduce myself briefly as well. I’m a corporate attorney here at Foley and a large portion of my practice focuses on advising founders of startups, both emerging and later stage, on general corporate matters, including and navigating through rounds of financing and ultimately the sale process. So, part of your focus really resonates with me, and I’m looking forward to diving into some questions.

First, I’ll just ask you - in your written pieces and speaking engagements, you talk a lot about building a founder’s brand. So, what does that actually mean in practical terms?

Patna 

Sure. So, building this brand is really about building credibility for the individual. It’s about showcasing their expertise, their knowledge in a specific field and when appropriate, also sharing some of their personality with the world because at the end of the day, it is the humans that you’re interacting with. Having that credibility and market visibility for a founder, I feel is extremely important.

One thing that I would like to clarify if I may, is that oftentimes I hear people confusing personal brand with self-promotion and bragging. But what we do and what we recommend as part of our strategy and what we also execute for the founders really has nothing to do with self-promotion. It’s really about developing a strategy for the founder, but most importantly positioning them. It’s similar to how you would position a company, right? Every founder that we work with has a three-word positioning where we go through a major process, but in short, I would say I founder brand is key to success.

Paige Moscow

And so, when you talk about founder brands, maybe you can share some examples from clients you’ve worked with in the past or success stories of branding founders.

Patna 

Let me step back and ask a question to your audience. I’m sure a lot of people have heard about Richard Branson, right? But I wonder if they can name the 400+ companies that are owned and controlled by the Virgin Group. Or even Rihanna, we all know her as an entertainer and musician, but she’s also an entrepreneur and founder of a couple of companies.

So my point being, most of the time we recognize people by their personal brand about who they are and what they’ve done and less of it is about how many companies or what product they’ve built. Now if we look at just stats alone, I’m sure this number has changed but as of 2020 there were more than 518 million entrepreneurs worldwide and about 30 million of them were in the U.S. And last year there were more than 5 million business applications filed, and this year there have been 1.74 million business applications to date.

The reason I bring this up is to show that if you are one of those 5 million plus entrepreneurs, how do you stand out? And I think that that’s one of the reasons why when we work with companies, especially first-time entrepreneurs, we find it to be extremely important that we build out the “who they are” and also think about it as a political campaign. If you’re looking at a personal run, for example, you know the field is crowded, and we are voting for a candidate based on what we know, how visible are they? Are they credible enough that we know that they are going to actually get the job done for what we vote for them? I feel like that is what I think about when we are building out the brand.

So, like I said, almost every founder that we worked with or every executive we worked with, they all have a personal positioning to start with. And case in point, one of them, we worked with them for over 3 1/2 years, and he was the face of this particular company. And the reason we positioned him as a CX [customer experience] connoisseur was because one of his biggest strengths was how good he is with customers and closing deals.  if there’s a problem somewhere with the customer, he knows exactly what to do. We also considered his personal goals, which is something we look for what happens when he is no longer with this company.

I believe personal brand must be portable. Whether you are no longer with the company or your company gets acquired, if you are too tightly tied to a company then you might have to rebuild your brand again, right? And in his case, we positioned him as the CX connoisseur and everything around the company positioning was also around customer experience. Given his personal positioning as a CX connoisseur, everything that he did, said, wrote, or spoke about had to do with CX.

It was all CX and digital transformation, CX and entrepreneurship, CX and STEM, etc. Everything revolved around that. That is also very important piece because you have to be on message and if you are positioning a certain way, you need to make sure that you stay that way. To kind of conclude this example, we worked with him for about 3 1/2 years and the company got acquired. One of the signature programs that we created for him, keeping in mind that brands need to be portable, was a podcast called the Science of CX.

So, when the company got acquired he was saying “Hey, what am I going to do next?” He kept his podcast going. That’s an example of how we do personal and executive positioning, help build their credibility, something that they can take with them, whether they’re starting another company, trying to do consulting work, or what have you.

Paige Moscow

You know, I think that’s fascinating because I feel like a lot of times when you think about the word marketing you think about trying to market a company and a product. A lot of folks who are starting companies are thinking about “how do I market my product” at the entity level. And you bring up a perfect point that oftentimes the focus has missed that the individual who is running the company needs a brand of their own. That’s a very powerful piece of the whole branding effort.

So obviously one of the main goals for many emerging startup companies is to bring in funding from venture capital firms or other high net-worth individuals or investors. So, can you talk a little about how founder branding intersects with the fundraising process?

Patna 

Great question, Paige. Yes, the two absolutely intersect. Investors invest in founders and customers buy from people so that human angle is right there. Based on my personal experience and also having spoken with several investors, I often say “what do you look for when you are looking at a company, or you want to fund a company or invest in a company?” One of the answers is always “we look at the founder, and they believe.” I don’t want to speak for all investors, but at least the ones that I know and have spoken with, they know that the founder or the founding team is very good at the technology that they’re building. It’s innovative, and they have competitive advantage, etc., etc. But at the end of the day, they want to know that the founder, who will eventually become the CEO of that company most of the time, is savvy about running a company, is a savvy entrepreneur, and knows how to scale the business because when investors are investing in your company, they do want return on their investments. When I was talking to investors about this very topic, they said that the technology is pretty cool, we know that it can evolve, and we can hire engineers and AI experts to help, but we need a founder who has the passion and vision to not only focus on the technology but know how they’re going to grow the company.

So, I would probably say that for investors to invest in a company and the founder, I think founders have to be more than the product they’ve built. Especially if they’re looking for investment - having worked with lots of tech companies and supported dozens of entrepreneurs I feel that is a very common thread, at least the clients that we’ve supported. If I look at the last few years, I’ve had the privilege of working with five companies that were acquired.

Paige Moscow

I mean, it connects to what we were just talking about. When you’re pitching a VC firm or investors, you are really pitching a personal brand. You are pitching the founder’s brand, so the focus isn’t as much on the technology or the product, which obviously is important, but a huge piece of it is you pitching yourself as the founder.

Patna 

Yes, you have to show your expertise not just in building the product, but also showing your entrepreneurial skill in that you are looking ahead with the investment dollars. How are you going to scale, and where are you going to go? Who are going to be your customers, and how quickly are you going to give me the return on my investment? I mean, at the end of the day, it’s about money.

Paige Moscow

Interesting. Okay, so backing up a bit. We were talking about the funding stage when you’re pitching to investors, but is it ever too early to start thinking about putting together a founder brand, even when you might not have a product yet? Is it ever too early?

Patna 

The short answer is never too early. As of last year, we’ve been working with three companies, one is in stealth mode. The other one has a product that’s gone into testing at airports, and one that is still deciding if the product is viable - they don’t have a prototype in essence. So, we have worked with each one of them to build out their product positioning. While they’re building the product and testing the product, we are absolutely focused on building out the CEO’s brand and the market credibility.

One of them in particular is in robotics, but the person does not have a high profile in the robotics industry. So, we’ve been working a lot with this individual to build out and spotlight her knowledge. She has the knowledge, but the world doesn’t know that. So, even though the product will not be ready for prime time until later in the year, we started working with this group while they were still developing.

The whole point and the premise here is that we have to spotlight the people behind the product. And show the world that they know what they’re doing. So when the product comes out you already know the human behind the company, right?

Paige Moscow

Right. So, you’ve talked a little about different strategies you’ve used for branding but do you use different kinds of strategies to develop market credibility for founders versus CEOs of more established companies?

Patna 

So, what we don’t have is a cookie-cutter strategy for every company. We also don’t have a cookie-cutter strategy for startups versus large companies because I believe every company is unique.

Every team that’s running a company and building a product is unique. So, it’s really important that we understand their business goals. We understand the market, we understand what their competitive advantages are. And then we create a highly customized program for each of the companies and the founder(s). But there are a few similarities, and when we go about the process, not only do we have to understand what the business goals are, but we absolutely have to understand what the personal goals are of a founder of a CEO of a large company. Because in fact, I almost always feel like I have to sign an NDA because I learn so much about someone, half of which I cannot use because its personal information. But what that does be that it allows me to know the person, know their passion, know what their weaknesses are, and then package all of that up and spotlight nothing but their expertise.

And when you’re building the strategy, you also make sure you know what they hate, where they don’t want to go, what they don’t want to talk about. When you are creating this package, you are always able to stay away from those because you know that’s not going to be helpful for other individuals or for the company. We intimately know the person’s character, history, and experience in addition to the business world, and that is one of the key factors that plays into our positioning strategy. That is kind of the consistent theme, whether you’re a startup founder or your large company founders. But the difference is that, as I was saying, brands have to be portable.

If you’re looking at the likes of an IBM, the founder isn’t there now and as the company grows or scales you bring in the CEOs or the business leaders who can take your company to the next level. There aren’t too many like Salesforce with the founder still there. Oftentimes, they’re very focused on promoting the product. It’s all about the speeds and feeds. It’s all about the technology, and yes, they’ll do customer service, but it’s around case studies, and it’s like very technical, very deep in the weeds.

So how do you position a 55-year-old company or 100 plus year company? You have to essentially bring everybody along with you while you are building a new strategy in conjunction with all the stakeholders, obviously. But what we’re also doing is humanizing that brand by putting faces or a face to the company because people are not buying from logos - logos don’t sell, it’s the humans that sell.

So analyzing the brand is kind of a consistent theme for us because that’s one of the key things that we do, whether we’re rebranding, getting them ready for fundraise, acquisitions, or what have you, and it’s a hard process; but I cannot see myself doing anything else.

Paige Moscow

You’ve obviously given a lot of advice and tips today on branding for founders and CEO’s of large companies that kind of spans the underlying themes. But so, if I were an entrepreneur just listening to this, what’s one tip you would give? Kind of a practical step that they can take to start working on their personal brand.

Patna 

The one tip that I often give to entrepreneurs and founders is, be the face of the company, because that humanizes the brand. And building your founder’s brand is not about you really. It’s really about building market credibility for your company, building market credibility for yourself. So that investors are going to invest in you and your company, and also it helps you reach your customers. They need to know who you are. You need market visibility and market credibility, so being the face of the company, I think is extremely important, especially for first time founders.

Paige Moscow

Well, thank you Patna. So I don’t know if you have anything else that you wanted to share to conclude, but I really appreciate your time today and this was a great conversation and I hope that it was helpful for any entrepreneurs or founders who are listening.

Patna 

Thank you so much, Paige. It’s been a pleasure talking to you. Thanks again for having me.

Construction,TechCrunch,Mycoprotein producer Enough raises €40M toward doubling its production capacity,Christine Hall,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8yMC9teWNvcHJvdGVpbi1lbm91Z2gtNDBtLWZvb2R0ZWNoL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8yMC9teWNvcHJvdGVpbi1lbm91Z2gtNDBtLWZvb2R0ZWNoL2FtcC8?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"Making protein out of mushrooms is not a new concept; however, Enough believes its technology — and the ability to scale production quickly — will set it apart.

The Scotland-based company grabbed €40 million ($43.5 million in today’s dollars) in new growth funding to test out that theory. Enough is pumping that dough into doubling the output capacity of its first production site in the Netherlands, completed last September.

Enough was founded as 3F BIO in 2015 by Jim Laird, who has a background in food operations. The company’s proprietary technology feeds fungi with sugars from renewable feedstocks and then ferments it similar to the way beer is made.

What results is the Abundant sustainable mucoprotein, which the company says has a neutral flavor and meaty texture and is high in protein and fiber. That protein can then be used to make plant-based meat, fish and dairy products.

The company also boasts that Abundant is “up to 15 times more efficient than protein from beef,” also using less feed and producing fewer carbon dioxide emissions, which is how it’s also more affordable to produce.

“What sets us apart is our focus on introducing high-scale capacity that will serve the market on a B2B basis and with the ability to grow in line with the growing market,” Laird said in an email interview. “As the protein transition continues there is a need for non-animal sources that make food that tastes as good or better and costs the same or less than the animal, and our process achieves that aim.”

Prior to building the Netherlands factory, Enough was producing small batches. Now with that online, the company is ramping up, initially producing over a tonne of Abundant every hour and around 10,000 metric tonnes per year.

The lead time from factory trials at its customers to the point where Enough supplies to retailers will often take six months, so the company does not expect retail launches until the end of the year, and more beginning in 2024, Laird said.

“We expect that demand could start to exceed our capacity by the second half of 2024, and for that reason, we are starting the installation of a second line,” Laird said. “Doubling our capacity is an important next step, but if we believe the estimates from the big banks and consultancies it is nowhere near enough to meet the growing global demand, which is forecasted to be about 10,000 tonnes per week, or the equivalent of one of our lines needed every week.”

Future plans include scaling up to over 60,000 tonnes per year starting in 2024, which Laird said would be the equivalent of growing one cow’s worth of protein every two minutes. The company expects to reach over a million tonnes, cumulatively, by 2032. Should the market continue in the forecasted trajectory, Laird said Enough has plans for a second location and is eyeing North America.

Today, Enough joins mushroom-focused food tech companies like Meat Foods and Fable Foods in bringing in a round of new venture capital. The growth funding, which closed this month, brings Enough’s total capital raised to date to over €95 million ($103 million).

World Fund and CPT Capital co-led the round, while existing investors, including AXA IM Alts through the AXA Impact Fund, HAL Investments through 280ppm, Onassis Group through Olympic Investments Inc., Tailored Solutions and Scottish Enterprise were also part of the investment.

The new investment will enable the company to scale up capacity at the factory and grow its teams across its offices in Glasgow, London and at SAS van Gent. Enough’s employee base doubled in size to 50 in 2022, and has now grown to 60, including adding John Gray as managing director of its Europe operations.

Meanwhile, the company is working with some of its partners, including Luzon Food Group, M&S and Unilever, on first-market launches. It is also gearing up to build its second production line to be completed at the end of 2024.

“We continue to strengthen the team in key areas and will continue to look at our growth finance needs,” Laird said. “The challenges in a growth industry is in aligning capacity with demand. Our balance over the coming years will be on installing capacity ahead of the growing demand curve.”","Enough is pumping that dough into doubling the output capacity of its first production site in the Netherlands, completed last September. The company's proprietary technology feeds fungi with sugars from renewable feedstocks and then ferments it similar to the way beer is made. The company boasts that Abundant is “up to 15 times more efficient than protein from beef” also using less feed and producing fewer carbon dioxide emissions.",20/08/23,21/08/23,,

Now, there are questions about whether this project will ever be built. Last month, Vattenfall said it would halt the first of three phases of the wind farm complex, the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone, which is projected to provide power for about four million homes in Britain.

Vattenfall blamed rapidly escalating costs for equipment and construction expenses, which it said had climbed as much as 40 percent over the past few quarters. The estimated price tag for the three phases has risen to 13 billion pounds, or about $16.6 billion, from £10 billion.

Instead of starting on Tuesday, Aug. 22 with the rest of Grand Rapids Public Schools, Montessori Elementary students will start school on Thursday, Aug. 24.

Parents of students received a letter Sunday notifying them of the change.

GRPS Superintendent Adriane Rob said school officials pushed to keep the first day of school on schedule, but it became apparent “staff needed more time to set up classrooms and get prepared to welcome scholars” after not being able to access the building due to supply and construction delays.

“After visiting the school over the weekend and talking with the building staff, we decided that a delayed start was most appropriate,” Rob said.

The Montessori Elementary building, located at 159 College Ave. NE, has undergone extensive renovations over the summer to add air conditioning and an upgraded heating system to the building. The renovation is expected to continue through the fall.

Construction,The Cincinnati Enquirer,What's next for Brent Spence Bridge project?,Patricia Gallagher Newberry,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wOC8yMC93aGF0cy1uZXh0LWZvci1icmVudC1zcGVuY2UtYnJpZGdlLXByb2plY3QvNzA1MTQ1NDQwMDcv0gEA?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"Groundbreaking dates, construction: What's next for Brent Spence Bridge project

Likely items on the 2023 punch list for the Brent Spence Bridge Corridor team:

Get Joe Biden to town to crow about federal support.

Hire primary contractors to launch the project.

Get a shovel in the ground.

With Nos. 1 and 2 complete – the president visited in January and contractors came on in July – officials are now moving toward a November groundbreaking, with “substantial construction” to follow next year or the year after.

As they firm up the calendar for $3.6 billion worth of construction, here’s what’s next for what will be the “largest project … ever built” by Ohio and Kentucky transportation departments, in the words of Ohio Department of Transportation (DOT) spokesman Matt Burning.

First on the list: Open houses for the public this Wednesday and Thursday.

What will be built when?

Bridge work will come first. That’s what will begin “later in 2024 or early 2025"" and continue to 2030, Burning said.

That phase of work will include reconfiguration of the existing Brent Spence Bridge, reducing both decks from four to three lanes for local traffic. It will also include construction of a new yet-to-be named companion bridge to the immediate west to carry Interstate 71 and Interstate 75 traffic.

Phase two of construction will run from Line Street to Findlay Street, starting in 2026 and ending in 2029.

The final phase will include work from Findlay to just past the Western Hills Viaduct. That will happen between 2029 and 2032.

Given the complexity of the work, “timelines may shift slightly from time to time,” Burning said. “However, we will continue to work with all parties to keep the project on target.”

What’s the order of the bridge work?

The companion bridge will be built before the upgrades on the existing bridge, according to Walsh Loosing Design-Build Team, the firm selected in July to lead the project. That will allow the new bridge to absorb traffic from the existing bridge when that work is under way.

Vehicles will be able to use one or the other bridge throughout the project, Burning confirmed.

But interruptions are possible. “Traffic impacts, road closures and delays are expected to maintain a safe work zone,” the project website says.

Walsh Loosing, by the way, is the primary contractor for just the first phase of work, with a $3.1 billion contract.

Work on the final two miles will happen under separate contracts, worth a combined $500 million. Contractors can bid for the second phase of work beginning in February 2026 and the third leg beginning in October 2028.

What does the project include besides bridge work?

In all, eight miles of I-71 and I-75 will see construction during the project. When complete, the interstates will be wider; on- and-off-ramps will be reconfigured; and streets over the interstates will be safer for pedestrians and bikes. Additionally, Ohio and Kentucky officials say they will fix flooding and sewer overflow issues in communities along the path.

In Cincinnati, I-75 will get a northbound exit at Edward Charles Drive, providing more access to West End, Over-the-Rhine, Cincinnati Museum Center and TQL Stadium. I-75 will also include a new interchange onto the Western Hills Viaduct.

Additionally, officials must win approval of an updated environmental assessment. They expect a response from the federal government on that by February.

What’s happening with Bridge Forward?

The Cincinnati grassroots group known as Bridge Forward continues to advocate for sinking I-75 and U.S. 30 as they pass by Downtown to allow for the city street grid to be extended into Queens gate.

That design would add $65 million to $80 million to the project cost, state officials have told Bridge Forward.

“It’s a chip shot to get to that,” former Cincinnati mayor and Bridge Forward supporter John Crawley said. “It really makes Queens gate a potential neighborhood.”

Burning confirmed the $65-to-$80 million estimates as “very preliminary,” adding that Ohio and Kentucky are not looking to add costs to the project. “We cannot answer where those additional funds would come from,” he said.

Bridge Forward leaders are investigating possible funding sources, founder Brian Poland said.

“We are confident that the local support is there if DOT will allow the local leaders to have the final say,” he said.

The group is currently seeking support from members of the Ohio Statehouse Cincinnati delegation, having won endorsement from Cincinnati City Council and Hamilton County Commission this spring.

Said Rep. Bill Sat, a Republican from Green Township: “I am for getting this project completed without one minute’s further delay and otherwise am ambivalent about the suggested changes.”

How can the public learn more or weigh in?

Members of the public can see exhibits, offer comment and talk with transportation officials at this week's open houses.

Wednesday, 4-7 p.m., at the Radisson Hotel, 668 W. Fifth St., Covington.

Thursday, 4-7 p.m., at Long worth Hall, 700 W. Pete Rose Way, Cincinnati.

A public hearing is expected in December, with details to come.

Comments and questions can also be submitted online, where answers to earlier questions are posted.","Officials are moving toward a November groundbreaking, with “substantial construction” to follow next year or the year after.

Luna-25, which launched on Aug. 11, was aiming to be the first mission to reach the moon’s south polar region. Government space programs and private companies all over Earth are interested in that part of the moon because they believe it may contain water ice that could be used by astronauts in the future.

The main purpose of Luna-25 was to test technology for landing on the moon, and the loss of the lander during a less risky phase of the mission will add scrutiny to Russia’s space struggles.

For missions headed to the moon’s surface, the two most nerve-racking moments are the rocket launch from Earth and the landing itself. Three lunar landing attempts in the past four years — by India, an Israeli nonprofit and a Japanese company — all successfully maneuvered in orbit around the moon before failing during the last few minutes descending to the surface.

When missions are lost during orbital engine firings, the cause often turns out to be shoddy manufacturing and inadequate testing. Those shortcomings were the basis for the failure of Russia’s last major robotic interplanetary probe, Phobos-Grunt, in 2011. Another factor could be embarrassing human error, like when NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter burned up in the Martian atmosphere in 1999 because of a mix-up between metric and imperial units.

Nathan Dismount, a senior scientist of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which led the scientific operations of Luna-25, said the spacecraft’s engine had not performed as designed during burns to adjust the spacecraft’s course.",Lunar landing attempts in the past four years successfully maneuvered around the moon before failing during the last few minutes descending to the surface.

Huck’s return will mean the Red Sox pitching staff will be as close to full strength as it has been all season. Fellow starter Chris Sale has already made two starts after coming off the IL on Aug. 11 and Garrett Whitlock is back in the bullpen after missing 32 games for his third IL stint of the season.

The Red Sox will need to cut a pitcher from their active roster to make room for Huck on Tuesday. Designating low-leverage righty Mauricio Lover for assignment is an option but the Red Sox could also option scuffling lefty Chris Murphy to the WooS ox to preserve depth (and keep Lover in the organization).

Huck had a 5.05 ERA in 13 starts since getting hurt, but the team is still high on his potential as a starter down the stretch. He’ll join Sale, Paxton, Bryan Hello, Butter Crawford and hybrid starter/reliever Nick Pipette in a loaded rotation mix.

“It’s huge for us,” Cora said Sunday. “Obviously, we’ve going to have to make a move, but I think finally, pitching staff-wise, we’re at full force. Is it late? We don’t know. But we’re in a good place now. These guys have thrown the ball well and the bullpen is going to get better.”

After Paxton and Huck start the first two games in Houston, Sale will go Wednesday before Hello pitches Thursday’s matinée finale. It’s expected to be Crawford on the mound Friday night when the Red Sox open a big interleague series against the Dodgers at Fenway Park.

Red Sox vs. Actors schedule, pitching probables:

Monday, 8:10 p.m. ET — LHP James Paxton (7-3, 3.34 ERA) vs. RHP Cristian Javier (8-2, 4.49 ERA)

Tuesday, 8:10 p.m. ET — RHP Tanner Huck (3-6, 5.05 ERA) vs. RHP Justin Overland (8-6, 3.36 ERA)

Wednesday, 8:10 p.m. ET — LHP Chris Sale (5-3, 4.50 ERA) vs. RHP José Liquid (2-3, 5.21 ERA)

Thursday, 2:10 p.m. ET — RHP Bryan Hello (9-7, 3.70 ERA) vs. RHP J.P. France (9-4, 2.75 ERA)",Tanner Huck will pitch against the Actors instead of starting Monday’s series opener. Lefty James Paxton will pitch Monday’s series opener on regular rest. The decision will give Huck an extra day after he made his last rehab start.,20/08/23,21/08/23,,

Aug 21 (Reuters) - Australia's no. 1 power producer AGL Energy (AGL.AX) said on Monday it had signed an agreement with the state of Victoria to provide certainty and a structured transition ahead of the scheduled closure of its Low Yang A power station in mid-2035.

The agreement also provides for an earlier-than-scheduled closure of the coal-fired power plant if it is not needed for ""the reliable and secure supply of electricity in Victoria"", as determined by the country's energy market operator, AGL said.

The structured transition agreement with the state provides a ""higher level of certainty around the ongoing operations, future closure"" and subsequent costs associated with the power station and the associated mine, AGL, which is also the country's top carbon polluter, said.

The deal provides greater clarity on avoiding an unplanned closure of Low Yang before the scheduled date, rehabilitation of the associated mine, investment in replacing the power generation capacity, and ensuring reliable and secure power supply.

In September last year, AGL Energy brought forward the closure of its coal-fired Low Yang power plant by a decade to 2035, buckling down to pressure from investors and lenders.

Shares of the power producer, which reported an upbeat annual underlying profit earlier this month, were trading 0.6% lower than at 0033 GMT.

Energy Transition

Delivery vans in Pittsburgh. Buses in Milwaukee. Cranes loading freight at the Port of Los Angeles. Every municipal building in Houston. All are powered by electricity derived from the sun, wind or other sources of clean energy.

Across the country, a profound shift is taking place that is nearly invisible to most Americans. The nation that burned coal, oil and gas for more than a century to become the richest economy on the planet, as well as historically the most polluting, is rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels.

A similar energy transition is already well underway in Europe and elsewhere. But the United States is catching up, and globally, change is happening at a pace that is surprising even the experts who track it closely.

Wind and solar power are breaking records, and renewables are now expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the world’s largest source of electricity. Automakers have made electric vehicles central to their business strategies and are openly talking about an expiration date on the internal combustion engine. Heating, cooling, cooking and some manufacturing are going electric.

As the planet registers the highest temperatures on record, rising in some places to levels incompatible with human life, governments around the world are pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy to cut the carbon pollution that is broiling the planet.

1 2 3 4 A big shift in the way America produces energy is already underway. Continue scrolling

The cost of generating electricity from the sun and wind is falling fast and in many areas is now cheaper than gas, oil or coal. Private investment is flooding into companies that are jockeying for advantage in emerging green industries.

“We look at energy data on a daily basis, and it’s astonishing what’s happening,” said Faith Tirol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. “Clean energy is moving faster than many people think, and it’s become turbocharged lately.”

More than $1.7 trillion worldwide is expected to be invested in technologies such as wind, solar power, electric vehicles and batteries globally this year, according to the I.E.A., compared with just over $1 trillion in fossil fuels. That is by far the most ever spent on clean energy in a year.

Those investments are driving explosive growth. China, which already leads the world in the sheer amount of electricity produced by wind and solar power, is expected to double its capacity by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. In Britain, roughly one-third of electricity is generated by wind, solar and hydropower. And in the United States, 23 percent of electricity is expected to come from renewable sources this year, up 10 percentage points from a decade ago.

“The nature of these exponential curves sometimes causes us to underestimate how quickly changes occur once they reach these inflection points and begin accelerating,” said former Vice President Al Gore, who called attention to what he termed a “planetary crisis” 17 years ago in his film “An Inconvenient Truth.” “The trend is definitely in favor of more and more renewable energy and less fossil energy.”

Even as the pace of change in the United States is surprising everyone from energy experts to automobile executives, fossil fuels still dominate energy production at home and abroad.

Corporations are building new coal mines, oil rigs and gas pipelines. The government continues to award leases for drilling projects on public lands and in federal waters and still subsidizes the industries. After posting record profits last year, leading oil companies are backing away from recent promises to invest more heavily in renewable energy.

The scale of change required to remake the systems that power the United States — all the infrastructure that needs to be removed, re-engineered and replaced — is mind-boggling. There are major challenges involved in adding large amounts of renewable energy to antiquated electric grids and mining enough minerals for clean technologies. Some politicians, including most Republicans, want the country to continue burning fossil fuels, even in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus that their use is endangering life on the planet. Dozens of conservative groups organized by the Heritage Foundation have created a policy playbook, should a Republican win the 2024 presidential election, that would reverse course on lowering emissions. It would shred regulations designed to curb greenhouse gases, dismantle nearly every federal clean energy program and boost the production of fossil fuels.

And while energy systems are changing fast, so is the climate. It is far from certain whether the United States and other polluting countries will do what scientists say is required to avert catastrophe: stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050. All the investment so far has slowed the pace at which emissions are growing worldwide, but the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is at record levels.

And yet, from Beijing to London, Tokyo to Washington, Oslo to Dubai, the energy transition is undeniably racing ahead. Change is here, even in oil country.

‘Energy Is Energy’

As the workday begins in Tulsa, Okla., the assembly line at the electric school bus factory rattles to life. Crews fan out across the city to install solar panels on century-old Tudor homes. Teslas and Ford F-150 Lightnings pull up to charging stations powered in part by the country’s second-largest wind farm. And at the University of Tulsa’s School of Petroleum Engineering, faculty are working on ways to use hydrogen as a clean energy source.

Tulsa, a former boomtown once known as the “Oil Capital of the World” where the minor league baseball team is the Drillers, is immersed in a new energy revolution.

At the port, an Italian company, Eel, is building a $1 billion solar panel factory. The bus factory is operated by Movistar, one of the biggest commercial vehicle makers in the world. And the city’s main electric utility, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, now harvests more than 28 percent of its power from wind.

1 2 3 4 5 Even Tulsa, with its strong links to oil and gas, is embracing clean energy. Continue scrolling

Clean energy entrepreneurs are flocking to Oklahoma, too. Francis Energy, a fast-growing maker of electric vehicle charging stations, is based in Tulsa. Canon, an electric vehicle start-up, is building a 100,000-square-foot battery factory at a nearby industrial park and a manufacturing plant for its trucks in Oklahoma City, though there are questions about whether the company will have enough funding to realize its plans. And teams from Solar Power of Oklahoma are busy fastening photovoltaic panels to the roofs of homes and businesses around Tulsa.

The city is embracing its shifting identity.

“We have a tremendous sense of pride in our history,” said Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., the Republican former mayor of Tulsa who was an oil and gas executive but now helps recruit clean energy companies to the region. “But we also understand that energy is energy, whether it is generated by wind, steam or whatever it might be.”

Around the country, clean energy is taking root in unlikely locales.

Houston, home to more than 500 oil and gas companies, also has more than 130 solar- and wind-related companies. Some of the country’s largest wind and solar farms are in the Texas flatlands outside the city, and a huge wind farm has been proposed off the coast of Galveston.

In Arkansas, a planned solar farm — the state’s biggest — is expected to help power a nearby U.S. Steel factory that is undergoing a $3 billion upgrade. When complete, the plant will use electric furnaces to mold scrap steel into new products. That will result in about 80 percent less greenhouse gases, the company says, and set the pace for an industry that has been a major polluter.

About two-thirds of the new investment in clean energy is in Republican-controlled states, where policymakers have historically resisted renewables. But with each passing month, the politics seem to matter less than the economics.

“We’re the reddest state in the country, and we’re an oil and gas state,” said J.W. Peters, president of Solar Power of Oklahoma. “So it took a lot of time to convince people that this wasn’t snake oil.”

Mr. Peters was broke six years ago, with less than $400 in his checking account after his contracting business slowed down. Then he responded to a help-wanted ad looking for workers to install solar panels, which were becoming more popular in Tulsa. He now employs 61 workers and has $18 million in annual sales. “The environmental benefits are nice,” he said, “but most people are doing this for the financial opportunity.”

‘Something Very Dramatic’

Fifteen years ago, solar panels, wind turbines and battery-powered vehicles were widely viewed as niche technologies, too expensive and unreliable for mainstream use.

But clean energy became cheap far faster than anyone expected. Since 2009, the cost of solar power has plunged by 83 percent, while the cost of producing wind power has fallen by more than half. The price of lithium-ion battery cells fell 97 percent over the past three decades.

Today, solar and wind power are the least expensive new sources of electricity in many markets, generating 12 percent of global electricity and rising. This year, for the first time, global investors are expected to pour more money into solar power — some $380 billion — than into drilling for oil.

The rapid drop in costs for solar energy, wind power and batteries can be traced to early government investment and steady improvements over time by hundreds of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs around the world.

“The world has produced nearly three billion solar panels at this point, and every one of those has been an opportunity for people to try to improve the process,” said Gregory Hemet, a solar power expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “And all of those incremental improvements add up to something very dramatic.”

An equally potent force, along with the technological advances, has been an influx of money — in particular, a gusher since 2020 of government subsidies.

In the United States, President Biden signed a trio of laws during his first two years in office that allocated unprecedented funds for clean energy: A $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law provided money to enhance the power grid, buy electric buses for schools and build a national network of electric vehicle chargers. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act set aside billions of dollars for semiconductors vital to car manufacturing. And the Inflation Reduction Act, which marks its first anniversary on Aug. 16, is by far the most ambitious attempt to fight climate change in American history.

1 2 3 4 5 The United States is ramping up its capacity to produce electric vehicles, batteries, solar panels and wind turbines. Continue scrolling

That landmark law provided tax breaks related to electric vehicles, heat pumps and energy efficiency upgrades, solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing and clean hydrogen production. The government is also investing in efforts to capture carbon emissions and store them before they can reach the atmosphere, as well as technology that can remove them directly from the air.

Originally estimated to cost roughly $391 billion between 2022 and 2031, the tax breaks are proving so popular with manufacturers and consumers that estimates now put the cost as high as $1.2 trillion over the next decade.

Combined, the three laws have prompted companies to announce at least $230 billion in manufacturing investments so far. In Georgia, a Korean solar manufacturer, Cells, is building a $2.5 billion plant. In Nevada, Tesla is building a new $3.6 billion electric truck factory. And in Oklahoma, the Eel and Canon facilities are primed to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, as is a new $4.4 billion battery factory being considered by Panasonic, the Japanese conglomerate.

“There’s a lot of appetite to invest in the United States thanks to that law,” said Giovanni Berlin, an executive at Eel, adding that the plant his company is building in Tulsa would not exist without the Inflation Reduction Act.

Regulations are also hastening the energy transition. Mr. Biden has proposed tough new federal pollution limits on tailpipes and smokestacks, but several states are acting on their own. California, with market muscle that influences the entire auto industry, plans to halt sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and new diesel-powered trucks by 2036 — and a handful of states are following suit. In May, New York became the first state to ban gas hookups in most new buildings, requiring all-electric heating and cooking starting in 2026. Several cities, including New York and San Francisco, have similar prohibitions, although some Republican-controlled states have blocked their municipalities from banning gas.

Heavy investment by the United States has spurred a spirited reaction from other wealthy nations. Countries that initially complained that the United States was unfairly subsidizing clean energy manufacturers have since engaged in a sort of friendly subsidy race.

1 2 3 Clean energy investments are generating thousands of new jobs. Continue scrolling

Canada, South Korea and others have pushed for their companies to have better access to the American incentives, while offering similar subsidies to their domestic manufacturers. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the European Union moved to lessen its dependence on Russian oil and gas. In May, for the first time ever, wind and solar power in the E.U. generated more electricity than fossil fuels.

And in China, which is currently both the world’s top polluter and the global leader for renewable power, the government continues to invest in every stage of clean energy production, from solar cells to batteries, wind turbines and more. Like the United States, China provides subsidies to buyers of electric vehicles. Last year it spent $546 billion on clean energy, far more than any other country in the world.

With costs falling fast, manufacturing has picked up and installations of solar and wind projects have increased. The U.S. solar industry installed a record 6.1 gigawatts of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, a 47 percent increase over the same period last year.

And those low costs have led many of the United States’ biggest corporations, such as Alphabet, Amazon and General Motors, to purchase large amounts of wind and solar power, because it burnishes their reputations and because it makes good economic sense.

“We’re seeing the nonlinear change happen before us,” said Jon Coats, chief executive of RMI, a nonprofit organization that promotes the energy transition. “And that’s important, because we’re facing a climate crisis right now.”

‘A National Phenomenon’

Steve Serving’s Tulsa home is a model of energy efficiency. He replaced all his incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. He installed a heat pump and rooftop solar panels this year. And he drives a plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion and a Tesla Model 3.

Mr. Serving, a mechanical engineer, said he wanted to see renewable power take off in Oklahoma and was trying to do his part. But he was also driven by his wallet.

“My fuel cost is equivalent to getting 200 miles a gallon on gasoline,” he said. “We charge at night, when we get a much cheaper rate on our electricity.”

Millions of people around the country are making similar calculations. Electric vehicles are by far the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, with record sales of 300,000 in the second quarter of 2023, a 48 percent increase from a year earlier. Teslas are now among the best-selling cars in the country, and Ford has expanded its production of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of its popular pickup truck, after a surge of initial demand created a waiting list.

Concerns among consumers about the availability of charging stations as well as the cost of some models have helped to cool sales somewhat, leading some automakers to slash prices. Still, federal tax credits of up to $7,500 have made the least expensive electric vehicles competitive with gas-powered cars. And about two dozen states offer additional tax credits, rebates or reduced fees, further pushing down their cost.

Government action is also helping heavier vehicles go electric. Sales of electric school buses are soaring, largely because of $5 billion in federal grants that can cover 100 percent of the cost for low-income communities. The Postal Service plans to spend nearly $10 billion to purchase 66,000 electric mail trucks — roughly 30 percent of its fleet — over the next five years.

1 2 3 Electric vehicles sales are growing quickly, but consumers are still concerned about high upfront costs and charging availability. Continue scrolling

In the private sector, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian. Tesla has an electric , as do several other manufacturers, including Petering.

Companies that provide charging stations are springing up to meet the demand. Francis Energy has more than 400 chargers across Oklahoma and is expanding nationwide. Ego, which has one of the largest fast-charging networks in the United States, plans to more than double the 3,000 charging stalls it operates.

“It is not a red-state, blue-state thing,” said Cathy Zoo, Ego’s chief executive. “It is a national phenomenon.”

In an unusual move, seven carmakers — BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis — are spending $1 billion in a joint venture to build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.

The shift is happening so quickly that some of America’s most iconic automakers are preparing for a world beyond gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

General Motors, which has the largest market share of any carmaker in the United States, has committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. It’s a “once-in-a-generation inflection point” for the 114-year-old automaker, according to Mary Barry, G.M.’s chief executive.

In an interview, Ms. Barry said her company began to consider an all-electric future in 2020. “We started to see this happening with the consumer research we did,” said Ms. Barry, who has subsequently bet billions on G.M.’s efforts to reorient its engineering, overhaul its manufacturing facilities and processes and build new battery plants.

As the cost of batteries comes down, and the number of charging stations nationwide goes up, Ms. Barry expects exponential growth. “I think it’s going to be definitely an upward trajectory,” she said. “It’ll be a little bumpy, but bumpy growing.”","A profound shift is taking place across the country that is nearly invisible to most Americans.

Record high temperatures were recorded in Texas and other states. People were told to chug extra water while mowing lawns or exercising outdoors, and to check on neighbors to ensure air conditioning is available. The extreme heat prompted Texas’ electric power grid manager to ask residents to voluntary conserve power for three hours on Sunday night.

“These high temperatures can impact our friends, families, and neighbors who may live alone, especially if they limit their use of air conditioning,” Sarah Russell, commissioner for the St. Louis Emergency Management Agency, said in a statement. “We urge everyone to stop and visit loved ones to ensure they are healthy and well during this extreme heat.”

The Dallas-Fort Worth area was expected to reach 110 F Sunday after hitting 108 F Saturday, said Sarah Barnes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The record high for those dates was 107 F, set in 2011.

The area is not cooling-off enough at night, Barnes said.

“That’s really going to contribute to an increased risk of heat-related illnesses,” Barnes said Sunday. “That’s the main concern when it comes to people and the heat.”

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or EPCOT, on Sunday asked the state’s 30 million residents to voluntarily reduce power use from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. CDT because of “extreme temperatures, continued high demand and unexpected loss of thermal generation.”

EPCOT’s request for voluntary power conservation was the second such request in the past three days. The agency said it was not in emergency operations. Many residents still view the power grid nervously more than 2.5 years after a deadly winter blackout.

The heat wave causing misery this weekend is just the latest to punish the U.S. this year.

Scientists have long warned that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, by deforestation and by certain agricultural practices, will lead to more and prolonged bouts of extreme weather, including hotter temperatures.

The entire globe has simmered to record heat both in June and July. And if that’s not enough, smoke from wildfires, floods and droughts have caused problems globally.

The National Weather Service set an excessive heat warning Sunday for parts of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska. Heat advisories or watches were also in place in parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and South Dakota.

Tourism in New Orleans often slows during the peak of summer heat, and that’s happening as temperatures approach 100 F.

NOLA Po boys is closing two days a week for now, said Lucas McQueen, one of the restaurant’s chefs. “I can’t wait to be complaining about being cold,” McQueen told DW-TV.

The temperature reached a record high for the date of 104 F Saturday in Jackson, Mississippi, as people walked between indoor and outdoor events at the Mississippi Book Festival. Volunteers distributed chilled water, and people used handheld fans while chatting with authors and shopping for books at large tents outside the state Capitol building.

Houston on Sunday added to its ongoing streak of high temperatures at or above 100 F. Through Sunday, the high temperature in Houston has been at least 100 F for 22 days. Sunday’s high was 108 F, breaking a record for the date that goes back to 1909.

The stifling heat in Texas overwhelmed people taking part in orientation for new students at Prairie View A&M University, 48 miles northwest of Houston. University officials said they were reviewing operations after 38 students were hospitalized Friday night after suffering heat-related illnesses, including dehydration. One student was taken by helicopter to a hospital in nearby College Station, while 37 were taken in ambulances to other facilities, Waller County EMS Chief Rhonda Henchman told KBTX.

“It’s very easy to overheat quickly in this Texas heat. We highly encourage everyone to stay indoors as much as possible,” Henchman said.

Much of Iowa is expected to see high temperatures in the upper 90s Sunday and Monday, followed by three days when the reading will likely top 100 F.

The heat was worrisome for Sunday as thousands were expected for the final day of the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. In a Facebook post, fair officials urged patrons to visit air-conditioned buildings, take regular breaks and stay hydrated.

Forecasters expected high temperatures to reach 99 F (37.2 C) to 103 F (39.4 C) through Friday in St. Louis, and the heat’s only part of the problem: Excessive humidity will lead to a heat index of up to 115 F (46.1 C) each day. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that if the prediction holds, it will be the worst stretch of heat in St. Louis since August 2014, when temperatures rose to about 95 F (35 C) for seven straight days.

Similar heat is expected all week in Little Rock, Arkansas, prompting the community to open several cooling centers for people who live on the streets or without air conditioning.

Last month, the Phoenix area broiled under a record-setting 31 days of daily high temperatures of 110 F (43.4 C) or above. The historic heat began blasting the region in June, stretching from Texas across New Mexico and Arizona and into California’s desert. The previous record was 18 straight days in 1974. In July, the continental United States set a record for overnight warmth, providing little relief from daytime heat for people, animals, plants and the electric grid, meteorologists said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports just 600 to 700 heat deaths annually in the United States. But experts say the mishmash of ways that more than 3,000 counties calculate heat deaths means the public doesn’t really know how many people die in the U.S. each year.",The heat wave causing misery this weekend is just the latest to punish the United States this year.

Furthermore, global heat maps show that the Indonesian archipelago and the Gulf of Guinea near Nigeria have the greatest potential for floating solar arrays.

Floating solar, also known as floating photovoltaic (FPV) or floating solar farms, involves the installation of solar panels on water bodies such as lakes, reservoirs, and canals. Experiments with floating solar date back to the 1970s. However, recent advancements in technology and growing environmental concerns have sparked renewed interest in installing floating solar systems on the surface of the oceans.

While land-based solar options may be limited in highly populated regions due to land use conflicts, offshore floating solar offers an attractive alternative, especially in regions that experience calm seas with minimal waves and winds. Such areas could generate up to one million Two per year, five times more than the solar energy needs of a fully decarbonized global economy supporting 10 billion affluent people, the researchers conclude.

Floating Solar In The ICT

These proposed offshore solar installations would be located in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, known to offshore sailors as the doldrums for their lack of wind and calm seas. In the days of sail power, ships would often get stuck there with no wind to fill their sails, sometimes for weeks.

The ICT extends approximately five degrees north and south of the equator, in which the prevailing trade winds of the Northern Hemisphere collide with the trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere, cancelling each other out. Due to intense solar heating near the equator, the warm, moist air is forced up into the atmosphere like a hot air balloon. Because the air circulates in an upward direction, there is often little surface wind in the doldrums. Below is an excerpt from the study.

This study assesses the potential of ocean surfaces for floating solar PV sites. Preferable places for maritime solar panels are those where maximum wave heights and wind speeds are low because this reduces the cost of the engineering defenses required to protect the panels. 40 years of maximum hourly wind speed and wave height data were analyzed to map the preferable sites for floating solar PV. The largest wave heights and wind speeds experienced during the years 1980 to 2020 were selected to characterize suitability, since it is maximum values that drive the cost of engineering defenses.

“The ocean’s surface covers 363 million km2, which is about 72% of the earth’s surface. The scope of this research encompasses sea and ocean surfaces within 300 km of land. The analysis is conducted at a spatial resolution of 11 km to provide an assessment of the potential for maritime floating solar PV sites. It is the first comprehensive survey of the scope required for maritime floating solar PV that considers factors such as hourly maximum wave height and hourly maximum wind speed.”

Calm Seas & Shallow Waters

Most of the global seascape experiences waves larger than 10 meters (32.8 feet) high and winds stronger than 20 meters per second (70 km/h). Several companies are working to develop engineering defenses so offshore floating panels can tolerate those conditions. However, benign maritime environments along the equator require much less robust and expensive defense mechanisms. Regions that don’t experience waves larger than 6 meters or winds stronger than 15 meters per second could generate up to one million Two per year the study found.

Shallow seas found close to large land masses are preferred for anchoring the floating solar panels to the seabed, according to a report on the research by The Conversation. However, because of the proximity to land, careful attention must be paid to minimizing damage to the marine environment, fishing activities, and shipping lanes. The researchers also note that global heating may alter wind and wave patterns in ways that are not easily predictable.

Floating solar installations on the surface of the ocean present challenges, particularly from salt corrosion and marine fouling. Yet despite these challenges, they believe offshore floating panels will provide a large component of the energy mix for countries that have access to calm equatorial seas. They predict that by mid-century, about a billion people in these countries will rely mostly on solar energy.

“We have found the most suitable regions cluster within 5–12 degrees of latitude of the Equator, principally in and around the Indonesian archipelago and in the Gulf of Guinea near Nigeria. These regions have low potential for wind generation, high population density, rapid growth (in both population and energy consumption) and substantial intact ecosystems that should not be cleared for solar farms. Tropical storms rarely impact equatorial regions,” the researchers say.

Indonesia & West Africa

Indonesia is a densely populated country, particularly on the islands of Java, Bali, and Sumatra. By 2050, its population may exceed 315 million people. About 25,000 square km of solar panels would be required to support an affluent Indonesia after full decarbonization of the economy using solar power.

Indonesia has the option of floating vast numbers of solar panels on its calm inland seas. The region has about 140,000 square km of seascape that has not experienced waves larger than 4 meters or winds stronger than 10 meters per second in the past 40 years. Indonesia’s maritime area of 6.4 million square km is 200 times larger than required if Indonesia’s entire future energy needs were met from offshore floating solar panels.

The waters in the Gulf of Guinea near West Africa also would be suitable for offshore floating solar installations, which would bring abundant renewable energy to large parts of that continent.

The Takeaway

Enough sunlight falls on the Earth every 90 minutes to meet the energy needs of all 8 billion people currently living on our little blue lifeboat at the far edge of a minor galaxy for a year. All we need to do is harvest it in order to eliminate all carbon and methane emissions from the energy sector. As the world transitions to electric vehicles, that sector will be decarbonized as well.

This research suggests floating solar on the surface of the oceans could meet the combined energy needs of the entire world five times over. Will it be easy? No it will not be, just as it is not easy to extract oil from the North Slope of Alaska, build pipelines or large tankers, enormous refineries, and complex systems to deliver oil, gasoline, methane gas, and other industrial products to the end users.

We face extinction. Perhaps it is time to stop whining about how hard it will be to transition to renewable energy and start building the systems that will allow us to thrive in the future. Instead of building new coal and methane and nuclear-powered generating stations, it is time to stop digging the hole deeper and start thinking about how to survive for millennia to come. This research is a road map to a sustainable future. We should follow it.

Around 350 households across Leicestershire are set to benefit after Leicestershire County Council, in partnership with district authorities, was awarded £6.8 million by the government over the next two years to support the installation of energy efficiency improvements, which will reduce energy costs as well as making households warmer and greener.

The Home Upgrade Grant funding is available to homes without mains gas central heating living in priority neighborhood postcodes, and more widely where the annual household income is below £31,000, or where a member of the household receives certain benefits.

The new scheme aims to improve the energy efficiency of owner-occupier and private rental households most in need of support, reduce energy bills and tackle climate change. It follows on from previous successful funding bids delivered through the Warm Homes service and Green Living Leicestershire partnership, including the Green Homes Grant, Warm Homes Fund and Sustainable Warmth Competition.

The Home Upgrade Grant is delivered through Green Living Leicestershire, a partnership between Leicestershire authorities who work collectively to deliver projects supporting sustainability and net-zero across the county.

The partnership is delivering funding on behalf of Baby District Council, Hardwood Borough Council, Scarborough District Council, Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council, Melton Borough Council and North West Leicestershire District Council.

A similar scheme using Sustainable Warmth Competition funding last year saw more than £1.75m spent on installing energy-efficient measures in almost 170 homes across the county to date, with additional works due to be completed by the end of September.

Under the latest Home Upgrade Grant funding, eligible county residents will benefit from an expert assessment that recommends the improvements best suited to their property, which may include insulation, low carbon and renewable technologies.

Funding is targeted at homes where the main source of heating is something other than mains gas, such as electric, heating oil, LPG, or solid fuel. Households that only use gas for cooking or secondary room heating can still apply.

Low-income households and those living in identified priority neighborhoods with energy inefficient homes will be prioritized. Funding is available to homeowners and private tenants of landlords with small property portfolios.

The £6.8m Home Upgrade Grant funding has been awarded by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and administered through the Midlands Net Zero Hub.","The home upgrade grant funding is available to homes without mains gas central heating living in priority neighborhood postcodes.

The Summit of the Subpar Superpowers

Certainly, artificiality has always hovered over the so-called BRICS summits that have taken place since 2009. The acronym — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — was a Goldman Sachs marketing ploy that, with investor enthusiasm, blossomed into a transcontinental collusion of emerging market economies in opposition to the West. But collusion is too strong a word for what’s turned out to be lots of photo-ops. And the summit this time around has almost all members hobbling toward the Aug. 22 meeting in Johannesburg. Not a good look.

Indeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin will only be there via videoconference. He’s avoiding an international warrant for his arrest. Worse, his country may soon become a submerging market, if one is to judge from the ruble, which has lost half its value in a year’s time. As guest columnist Alexandra  writes, the only reason the Russian economy is growing is because of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine — “military Keynesianism,” as she puts it, as the Kremlin pours more and more of its budget into arms production and related industries. “When the war ends,” she says, “the sudden switch in demand from the inflated defense sector back to the civilian sector will be a powerful shock that will be impossible to absorb painlessly. As we know from history, it also proved impossible for Russia’s predecessor, the Soviet Union.”

China’s President Xi Jinping, unlike his Russian ally (or is it dependent?), will be in South Africa in person next week. But his presence is not going to camouflage the economic and financial headaches of the People’s Republic — analyzed with pitiless precision by Shula Men. Host South Africa has lost its stature as its continent’s country with economic and political mojo. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has just beat back a no confidence vote stemming from how his government has dealt with months of civil unrest in the northeast. Minor Sharma observes that a raft of new legislation will only promote the kind of ethnic chauvinism that exacerbated the violence there. Only Brazil is enjoying good economic news, despite its political transition from the rifting populism of Jair Bolsonaro to the revived socialism of Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva.

The big trouble with the BRICS is that China (with It's still enormous economic clout) dominates the group — and Beijing wants to turn it into another global forum to echo its denunciations of the US and EU. Hence, Beijing’s attempts to expand the membership to bring in sympathetic nations (e.g. Saudi Arabia). Brazil and India have resisted, preserving their own influence in the association. But why preserve influence in a China-dominated vessel that’s sprouting so many leaks?

If investors want EM excitement, maybe there’s another marketable acronym now that BRICS is past its sell-by date. Consider something called MISFIT, a regional Asian entity whose total weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index — 46% — would be larger than China’s 31.4%. Indeed, China would be a geopolitical reason for Malaysia, India, Thailand, Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan to band together. Oh, wait ... Taiwan? Never mind.

This Blessed Plot, This Realm, This Shark-Infested England?

In his latest column, Adrian Woodridge rhapsodizes the golden age of domestic British tourism from 1880 to 1914. “By the Edwardian era, 55% of the population were making day trips to the seaside, and another 20% were taking holiday accommodation there,” he writes. However, holidays in Blackpool, Margate, Bournemouth and other resort towns on the British seaside began to decline in the 1960s with the advent of consumer plane travel and packaged tours abroad. Climate change may be about to change that, however. “Familiar destinations in the Mediterranean and the US are becoming so hot that wildfires rage and sunbathers pass out,” Adrian writes. Furthermore, “A report commissioned by aviation industry groups estimates that the cost of reaching net-zero targets could reach €820 billion ($896.2 billion) by 2050. The age of cheap flying is coming to an end.”

So it might be best to stay put and go back to the days of vacationing on the British seaside. Except, what about all those stories that great white sharks may soon make appearances off St. Ives in Cornwall and UK waters as the planet warms up? What are prospective British tourists to do if they’re afraid to go back into their native waters? So far, all the credible great white sightings are on the US side of the North Atlantic. “Never say never, but it’s a shame that whenever anybody does claim to see one, they don’t seem to have their phone on them,” Paul Cox, CEO of charity Shark Trust, told Lara Williams.

In her column, Lara points out that the more than 40 documented species of shark in British waters aren’t man eaters. But half of them are under threat from humankind (see chart in next section). Says Lara: “Maybe great whites will eventually establish themselves off the coast of St. Ives. But spare a thought for the enigmatic species already here that we might soon lose.” Until then, she says, “the most dangerous thing you’re likely to encounter in British waters is raw sewage.”

“From flat-bodied angel sharks and portables to spotty nurse hounds and enormous basking sharks — gentle filter-feeders that would dwarf a great white — there’s incredible diversity. We’ve even got Greenland sharks, which have the longest known lifespan of any vertebrates. One study carbon-dated the eyes of Greenland sharks; the largest, a five-meter (16.4-feet) female, was between 272 and 512 years old. Unfortunately, more than 50% of the UK shark population is under threat.” — Lara Williams in “Sharks Need to be Cherished More Than Feared.”

Walk of the Town: The Hotel That Refused to Go Vegan

Once upon a time, there was a restaurant called Davies and Brook on the corner of the London streets that bear those names. It served delightful fare like oysters, a delightful duck and sugar-sprinkled donuts filled with warm apples. Then its chef Daniel Hume wanted it to go full vegan — just like his famous New York City restaurant Eleven Madison Park. But Davies and Brook was also within a famous hotel, in fact one of the most famous hotels in the world. And, in November 2021, Coleridge’s announced that it had decided to part ways with Hume.

It’s been nearly two years, and the expansive dining room has been expensively renovated (along with the rest of the hotel). Now simply called Coleridge’s Restaurant, it can still provide you with vegetarian and vegan selections. But you may also very comfortably remain a carnivore — an option that the hotel probably calculated its well-heeled clientele would overwhelmingly prefer.

The room itself is gorgeous: a revival of the hotel’s art deco roots. The duck wasn’t on the menu when I visited for lunch this week, but the oysters were wonderful as were the Dorset snails and the beef tartar (served with bone marrow and toast). Coleridge’s refused to bow to critics and move with the times. But I suspect the moneyed classes will continue to go with whatever Coleridge’s puts on the table. Nothing is priced too low.

Energy,The Atlantic,Is Mississippi Really as Poor as Britain?,Douglas Carswell,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF0bGFudGljLmNvbS9pZGVhcy9hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjMvMDgvYnJpdGFpbi1taXNzaXNzaXBwaS1lY29ub215LWNvbXBhcmlzb24vNjc1MDM5L9IBAA?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"The question is usually posed the other way around—which is an insult to the dynamic economy of this southern state that is now my home.

The shame of it! Mississippi has found itself in the humiliating position of being compared  with the United Kingdom. Just last week, the Financial Times ran a column asking, “Is Britain Really as Poor as Mississippi?”

Most Mississippians do not spend much time worrying about comparisons with Britain. The same cannot be said about those on the other side of the Atlantic. For Brits—and I am one, though now based in Jackson, Mississippi—the issue of whether they are more or less prosperous than Mississippi has become a thing. Indeed, the Financial Times now calls it “the Mississippi Question.”

It was nine years ago when Fraser Nelson, the editor of The Spectator, first suggested that the U.K. was poorer than any U.S. state but Mississippi. This came as an uncomfortable shock for many in Britain for whom Mississippi, as a byword for backwardness, conjures up clichés about the Deep South. Every time anyone has made the comparison since, there has been an indignant outburst from Britons keen to denounce the data.

In practice, when trying to provide a definitive answer to the Mississippi Question, no uniform, up-to-date set of data exists. But if you take the most recent U.S. figure for Mississippi’s GDP and divide it by the state’s population, you get a pretty accurate figure for GDP per capita in current dollar values. Make the same calculation for the U.K., with total GDP data divided by the population, and you end up with two comparable numbers.

Read: Punching above their weight in Mississippi

Last year, by my math, the U.K.’s output per person was the equivalent of $45,485; Mississippi’s was higher, at $47,190. If Britain were invited to join the U.S. as the 51st state, its citizens would be at the bottom of the table for per capita GDP. Some might say that, for Mississippi, that is still disconcertingly close.

“That’s not fair!” the critics would counter. “When you compare the wealth of nations, you need to look at how far the money goes. Things cost more in the U.K. than in Mississippi.” To adjust the raw numbers, the argument runs, you need to use an economist’s tool called “purchasing power parity.” Sure enough, when you consider differences in the price of things in Britain and in America, the U.K. does appear richer than Mississippi. Thus, after such PPP adjustments, a Financial Times analyst suggested that for 2021, Mississippi’s per capita GDP was a mere $46,841 to the U.K.’s $54,590 (though conceding that, without the global city-state effect of London’s economy, much of Britain was relatively poorer than the Magnolia State).

“Hold on!” we on Team Mississippi retort. “Why adjust the numbers for our state using U.S. national data?” Here, a dollar goes a lot further than it would in New England or on the West Coast. To produce PPP-adjusted numbers for Mississippi that reflect the buying power of a dollar in places like New York or San Francisco, we say, is absurd. And sure enough, tinkering with the numbers to reflect purchasing power in Mississippi itself puts doubt on the U.K. coming out ahead.

Perhaps more interesting, however, than the way you cut the numbers for any given year is the fact that the gap between Mississippi and Britain seems to be growing. Never mind PPP—just run the numbers for GDP per capita in current dollars for the first part of 2023, rather than 2022, and you can see that Mississippi’s output is rising at a faster rate than Britain’s.

See: Mississippi—images of the Magnolia State

Over the past 30 years, several southern U.S. states have seen rapid economic growth. Texas and Nashville, for example, have become economic hubs to rival California or Chicago. North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and even Alabama has all flourished. Mississippi was missing out. Until now.

Historically, business in Mississippi was highly regulated. Licenses used to be mandatory in order to practice many of even the most routine professions. The state has now lifted a lot of these restrictions, deregulating the labor market. According to a recent report by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group representing conservative state legislators, the size of Mississippi’s public payroll has been pared back. In 2013, there were 645 public employees out of every 10,000 people in the population; today, the number is down to 607. Last year, Mississippi also passed the largest tax cut in recent history, reducing the income-tax rate to a flat 4 percent.

How did this come about? policymakers here have drawn inspiration from the State Policy Network, a constellation of state-level think tanks, borrowing ideas that have worked well elsewhere. We got the idea for labor-market deregulation from Arizona and Missouri. Tennessee inspired us to move toward income-tax elimination. Florida’s successful liberalization stands as an example of how we could reduce more red tape.

What was once just a trickle of inward investment has turned into a steady flow. Growth is up, visibly: The areas of prosperity along the coast and around the state’s thriving university towns are getting larger, even if pockets of deprivation in the Delta remain.

Perhaps many in Britain find it hard to accept that Mississippi has overtaken them economically, because they still think of Mississippi as cotton fields and impoverished backwoods, peopled by folk who subsist on God, guns, and grits. But what if Britons’ reluctance to face changing economic realities comes from an outdated perception of themselves?

Most of my fellow Brits like to think that they live in a prosperous free-market society. They have not fully grasped the way in which their country has been sleepwalking toward regulatory regimentation. Stringent new regulations on landlords have seen thousands of owners pull out of the market, resulting in a dire shortage of rental accommodations. New corporate-diversity requirements have imposed additional costs across the financial-services sector, with little evidence that bank customers are getting a better deal.

Matthew Goodwin: Britons’ growing buyer’s remorse for Brexit

Individually, none of these restrictions matters all that much. But together, this relentless micromanagement inhibits innovation and growth. And Brits have become so accustomed to government red tape that they no longer seem to see the crimson blizzard that blankets so many aspects of their economic, and even social, lives.

To be fair to them, for many years it did not seem to matter that taxes rose, and the regulatory burden grew heavier. Thanks to the use of monetary stimuli in place of supply-side reform since the late 1990s, the country’s economy seemed to defy gravity, engineering the sort of growth that high taxes and tight regulation might otherwise preclude. Few in the U.K. seemed to notice as ever more aggressive doses of monetary stimuli were required to stave off a downturn. Only now that the option of further stimuli has been exhausted are the cumulative consequences of 30 years of folly becoming apparent.

To recognize that one’s country has been run on a false premise for three decades is difficult. To have to acknowledge that Britain is now poorer than the poorest state in the Union could prompt a moment of self-reckoning that many Brits seem determined to postpone.

Britain’s recurrent fixation with the Mississippi Question tells us as much about the country’s state of mind as it does about GDP. Rather than confront uncomfortable truths, my countrymen dispute the data. Instead of facing up to the consequences of bad public policy in Britain, many blame Brexit, or Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine might have caused higher energy prices, but it alone does little to explain Britain’s poor economic performance. As for Brexit, though commentators who originally opposed it love to blame the country’s woes on it now, they never seem to ask why, if leaving the European Union was the cause of Britain’s lack of growth, the country has still managed to outperform much of Europe.

Since Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, the U.K. economy has grown by 5.9 percent; German GDP has increased by only 5 percent. Unlike Germany, the U.K. has so far also managed to avoid recession. Far from a reduction in trade, Britain has seen a boom in exports, especially in the service sector, since withdrawing from the EU trade block. Service exports grew by nearly 23 percent in real terms from 2018 to 2022—the strongest growth in this sector among the G7 countries, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and far more than in neighbors such as Italy, Germany, and France.

Derek Thompson: How the U.K. became one of the poorest countries in Western Europe

In any case, Nelson posed the Mississippi Question nearly two years before Britain voted to leave the EU. The country’s lackluster output, productivity, and growth were apparent well before Brexit. Leaving the EU should have been a perfect opportunity to correct course, but little has been done to address the problem. In fact, after leaving the EU, Britain has been hit by a succession of disastrous policy choices.

Having rushed to impose a lockdown in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, British ministers insisted on more and more Draconian measures long after it was apparent that such steps were disproportionate, as well as ruinously expensive. Then, in the name of achieving net-zero targets on “decarbonizing” the U.K. economy by 2050, successive governments have made rash commitments to move to renewables. Higher energy costs have helped price British industry out of world markets.

Instead of changing course, ministers have stuck stubbornly to their dogma—even though the latest moves to outlaw the internal combustion engine and new emissions regulations are making car ownership unaffordable for millions.

Mississippi has managed to borrow good ideas that have proved to work elsewhere. Britain, by contrast, has preferred to pioneer its own bad ideas. The former approach helps explain why Mississippi is emerging as part of a wider southern success story. The latter approach accounts for why a once-successful country is really struggling.",The Financial Times now call it the Mississippi Question. It was nine years ago when Fraser Nelson suggested that the U.K. was poorer than any U.S. state but Mississippi. This came as an uncomfortable shock for many in Britain for whom Mississippi conjures up clichés about the Deep South.,18/08/23,21/08/23,,
Energy,Notes From Poland,Poland adopts dynamic electricity pricing amid growing share of ...,,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL25vdGVzZnJvbXBvbGFuZC5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wMi9wb2xhbmQtYWRvcHRzLWR5bmFtaWMtZWxlY3RyaWNpdHktcHJpY2luZy1hbWlkLWdyb3dpbmctc2hhcmUtb2YtcmVuZXdhYmxlcy1pbi1lbmVyZ3ktbWl4L9IBAA?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"Poland’s parliament has approved changes to energy laws that, among other things, will introduce dynamic pricing that allows electricity costs to be adjusted every 15 minutes based on supply and demand.

That is intended to address the challenges created by the growing share of renewable power sources in Poland’s energy mix. Their output can fluctuate significantly over the course of a day.

Lawmakers also hope that the change will reduce the need to sometimes shut down renewables when electricity production is too high compared to demand – for example, when there is a lot of wind or solar while electricity consumption is low.

Poland’s climate ministry has outlined plans for the country to generate three quarters of its electricity from zero-emissions sources by 2040, with 51% coming from renewables and almost 23% from nuclear https://t.co/CksVqGQXkV — Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) April 4, 2023

Parliamentary work on the legislation – which is designed to implement European Union directives – was completed on Friday when the lower-house SeSeempproved the majority of amendments proposed by the upper-house Senate, reports the GaGa zetayaily.

Most of the provisions adopted as part of the reforms, including the dynamic billing, will enter into force in July 2024.

Such dynamic tariffs are already offered to individual consumers in countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Austria and the UK. In Poland, they can currently only be used by certain business customers that have high energy use and have individually negotiated terms.

Poland declared an official threat to the security of electricity supplies for only the second time in history yesterday. The reason was an oversupply of renewable energy, with the grid operator ordering solar and wind to be disconnected temporarily https://t.co/XzdR1qcnpT — Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) April 24, 2023

Under the dynamic tariffs, the price of electricity updates every 15 minutes to reflect the current situation on the market. If electricity production is high, for example, prices are lower. They go up if power is in shorter supply and demand is high.

These measures are designed in part to encourage consumers to use energy when production is high and demand is low. That can in turn help avoid shutdowns of renewable energy plants, as has happened in Poland on particularly sunny or windy weekends or holidays when electricity consumption was low.

In July of this year, average 24-hour energy production in Poland was highest between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m., when solar power significantly boosted production, show data from the Jagiellonian Institute think tank.

According to the data from the same think tank, cited by GazeGa zetao not available publicly, average prices over the last 30 days were the lowest from noon to 4 p.m., bottoming out at 2 p.m. at 376 zlotzloties4.5) per MWh.

Meanwhile, the highest prices were in the morning between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and in the evening after 6 p.m., peaking at 9 p.m. at 626 zlotzloties40.8) per MWh.

Dynamic tariffs are to be offered by all power companies serving more than 200,000 end-users, but their use will be voluntary for customers.

Renewable energy micro-installations contributed over twice as much power to Poland's electricity network last year as in 2021. The majority of that came from home solar installations, which have boomed thanks to a state subsidy schemehttps://t.co/1ZRcy65gyZ — Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) March 21, 2023

A condition for taking advantage of dynamic pricing will be having a smart electricity meter. To date, only a fifth of electricity consumers in Poland have one. However, the government is aiming for 80% of homes to have one by 2028.

Other changes introduced in the revised energy law include the possibility of creating civic energy communities – which will be able to generate, store and sell energy – and the creation of a tool for comparing all offers available on the market for the sale of electricity to households and businesses with consumption of under 100 MWh a year.

Consortium including Hitachi Rail wins new €1.8bn digital signalling contract for high-speed line between Verona and Padua

EUR 1.8 billion contract builds on phase one award in 2020 worth €2.4bn to deliver  Vicenza line

Hitachi Rail will equip the line with cutting-edge ERTMS digital signalling system

ERTMS will allow more trains to use the line, at greater speed and with increased reliability

Naples, August 1, 2023 - Hitachi Rail, as part of the IRI CAV DUE Consortium has signed a €1.8 billion contract to design and deliver the track and the digital signalling that will cross the city of Vicenza with a new High Speed/Capacity (HS/C) line.

The signing of the contract between RFI and Consortium IRI CAV DUE, will enable Hitachi Rail – as a member of the Consortium – to start work on the Crossing of Vicenza. Although only 6.2 km in length, the connection will transform journeys for passengers looking to travel between Verona and Padua.

The project will see Hitachi Rail supply its European Rail Transport Management System (ERTMS) digital signalling to create the HS/C line. ERTMS is the most advanced system for the digital control of railways and uses radio signals between the train and track to monitor speed and automatically activate the train's emergency brakes if a hazard is identified or if the train exceeds the track's speed limit. This means that trains can safely run faster and closer together, improving service speed and reliability and allowing more trains on the track.

The ERTMS level 2 system is a significant step in railway interoperability, simplifying and optimizing train control on international railway networks. The traditional track-based signalling is replaced by radio communications between the trains and the Radio Block Center (RBC). This simplifies the railway environment by reducing the costs of the installation and maintenance of the traditional signalling systems. This technology will also allow trains from nearby European countries to operate on Italian railway lines without interruption, with the aim of creating a harmonious and integrated system throughout Europe.

The new contract follows the phase one award ( Vicenza) signed in August 2020, worth over EUR 2.4 billion. The new railway line will be 76.4 km long in total and, in addition to connecting the two cities, will complete the rail link between Milan and Venice.

Luca D'Aquila, COO Hitachi Rail Group and CEO Hitachi Rail Italy, said: ""We are particularly proud of this order: our ERTMS digital signalling will deliver for the customer and the passenger alike. Once installed, the system will enable a service that can safely travel at greater speed and with increased capacity on the line.""

The consortium delivering this contract is made up of Hitachi Rail (17.05%) and Rebuild Italia S.p.A. (82.95%).

Hitachi Rail has taken part in the construction of all the High Speed/Capacity Lines in service in Italy today, supplying its cutting-edge ERTMS digital signalling.

(“Duos” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: DUO), through its operating subsidiary Duos Technologies, Inc., a provider of machine vision and artificial intelligence that analyzes fast moving vehicles, today announced that the Company now has 13 Railcar Inspection Portals (“rip®” or “RIP”) in operation with four major railroads. The Company also recently reported that its RIP technology across those same 13 portals has performed over 3.8 million comprehensive railcar scans through the first half of 2023. This metric encompasses all railcars scanned at locations across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.







Duos also has two additional highly advanced RIP's being manufactured, which will be deployed on the high-speed rail network in the Northeast Corridor in the coming months. These advanced RIP's will deploy new machine vision technologies capable of capturing safety data at speeds of up to 125 miles per hour. Duo expects to deploy new wheel and brake inspection technologies with this installation. The Company also recently disclosed that it intends to build and deploy additional systems around the North American rail network which can be accessed via subscription, lowering the barriers to entry for acquiring a RIP system for railroads and railcar owners alike.

Duos’ RIP technology is rapidly becoming the industry standard for detecting and identifying mechanical issues on railcars as operators aim to meet the increasing need for compliance and safety solutions that are efficient, reliable, and cost-effective. The Company’s major railroad clients have multiple systems with artificial intelligence (“AI”) actively running on their rail networks. The Company recently released information surrounding its catalog of more than 40 AI detections and some the success stories on avoiding derailment risk with its end-of-car-cushion detection in the field.

“Through our ongoing rail industry involvement, we have been active in identifying the key metrics to support an increased safety focus including our consultation on the proposed Rail Safety Act of 2023,” said Duos CEO Chuck Ferry. “Related to that engagement, we have continued to develop our technologies to further support those efforts including significant AI development whereby we already have more than 40 highly effective models, operating with an often greater than 95% accuracy. We are also working with a Class 1 railroad who has applied for waivers to the current inspection methods in order to use the Duos RIP systems in their inspection plans. As we continue to expand our footprint and capabilities, we expect to drive greater interest from prospective customers as well as further improve our performance by leveraging an ever-growing dataset.”

“Our mission is to make this technology available to as many railroad operators, car owners and other related parties through our subscription offerings. This will allow a much lower pricing point for users to gain access to the data without the necessity to invest $10’s of millions of dollars to build and support their own network.”

Samantha Constanza went on a first date with a man she'd met on a dating app in January 2022. They got to know each other as they both sipped on hot cider because of the cold at the Brooklyn, New York, bar where they'd agreed to meet. When it was time to pay for the drinks, Constanza's date handed his credit card to the bartender. A few days later, he messaged that he'd like to see her again. Constanza didn't feel the same. ""I spent over an hour crafting a very polite reply that assured him I had a lovely time but just did not see a future connection,"" said Constanza, 29, a customer operations analyst. In response, the man asked Constanza if she could Venmo him back payment for her drinks. More from Personal Finance:

Americans think they need nearly $1.3 million for retirement

Why Americans are struggling with car loans

Most parents spend 20% or more of income on child care ""I was in complete shock,"" she said. ""It made it seem like the only reason he would offer to pay for my drinks was that he expected something from me."" Relationship and etiquette experts say the confluence of changing gender norms, popularity of payment apps and the economic climate tightening people's budgets is making the already fraught first date a little more tense. One symptom may be more awkwardness around how the tab is handled, at the moment and after the fact. Like Constanza, some women say they've had a male date ask for his money back after they explained they didn't want to go out again. ""We are culturally moving into a dating environment that we're all unfamiliar in,"" said New York-based psychotherapist Carl Beau.

Toxic behaviors in online dating apps

The requests for money back after a disappointing date are a symptom of a much bigger problem with modern dating, said Jon Bigger, author of "": How Dating Became a Lopsided Numbers Game."" These situations would be much less likely to occur on a first date involving two people set up by a mutual friend or a family member, he said. ""It's a byproduct of the awfulness and toxicity of online dating, where every first date is a blind date with a complete stranger,"" Bigger said. ""There's zero social accountability, which makes it easier for people to behave badly."" Dating coach Blaine Anderson said a money request after a date is among the biggest taboos. ""Venmo-requesting a woman to split your first date if she doesn't agree to a second date is pathetic and unethical,"" Anderson said.

Watch now

When men, in particular, ask for their money back, it can underscore the uncomfortable feeling women can get that their covered dinner came with expectations. ""The man considered the cost of that first date an investment, and that investment did not pan out,"" said dating app expert Irina Manta, co-host of the podcast Strangers on the Internet. Erin, a single 40-something in Pennsylvania who asked to use her first name only, felt unsettled when her date later asked for a refund. After their first dinner together, she knew she wasn't going to see him again because of his political views. When their check came, she offered to pay her portion, but he insisted on covering the full bill. But then, the next day, when she explained that she didn't want to see him again, he asked her to Venmo him $30.

There's zero social accountability, which makes it easier for people to behave badly. Jon Bigger author

""It really did feel very off-putting,"" said Erin. ""It really underscores some kind of sense of entitlement on his part."" Although many find the expectation that men pay for the first tab old-fashioned, others see it as a kind gesture or a way to show interest. Constanza said she would have been a bit put off if her date hadn't at least offered to pay. ""Each drink cost $10, so a total of $20 to cover me on a first date seemed like an expected and polite gesture to show his interest,"" she said.

How the economy is taking a toll

On the other hand, it's important to consider the economy as a backdrop, said psychotherapist Beau. Wage stagnation and inflation have left many people feeling squeezed, and dating can be very expensive. Americans spend nearly $700 on dates annually, with the average man spending the most — around $860, according to a 2020 report by . The average cost of a full dinner and a movie across major cities in the U.S. can cost around $159, according to a more recent analysis by Managed, conducted in 2023.

Watch now

""That can be really hefty when we're talking about an economy where people are struggling to pay their rent,"" Beau said. As a result, Beau saw the refund requests a little differently. ""Is it really that they had a bad intention [or] is it that they really couldn't afford it?"" she said.

What to do if it happens to you

If you receive a request from someone after your date, experts say there are pros and cons whether you ignore or pay it. Ignoring the request sends the message that it was inappropriate, while paying it could be the fastest way to cut ties and never interact again, said Anderson. Meanwhile, if you intend to request a refund from someone after a date, you may want to reconsider. It's better to ask to split the bill from the beginning and make your boundaries clear, said Beau. If getting the money back will help your finances or make you feel better about being rejected, ""it's your right to ask,"" she said.",Etiquette experts say the confluence of changing gender norms and popularity of payment apps is making the first date a little more tense.

Ohio University units that are currently utilizing the OHIO Business Service Center (BSC) for operational purchasing and travel now have access to a new portal that will directly connect them with business services staff and decrease response time.

The OHIO BSC is pleased to announce that it has implemented a “live chat” feature connected with Microsoft Teams that will allow you access to experienced staff, Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 5 p.m.

To access chat, navigate to My Bobcat Business and use the “Chat with a BSC purchasing/travel specialist.” The service is currently only available for units utilizing services in procurement and travel, but the BSC plans to expand this to other areas in the near future.

Renee Perry

A special thanks to Renee Perry, associate director of operational purchasing and travel, and Jeremy Grahame, technology and knowledge manager, who researched and assisted in the development of this tool with Microsoft.

“After recognizing our desire for a Live Chat feature, we contacted Microsoft to explore the potential. Our representative connected us with a technical expert who eagerly engaged with our requirements, a unique inquiry for them,” Perry said. “In a matter of hours, she collaborated internally at Microsoft and swiftly returned with a novel concept. This concept leverages Microsoft Forms and Power Automate to craft a Chat Feature within Teams. While Microsoft provided the groundwork, Jeremy skillfully tailored it for the BSC's specific needs.”

Jeremy Grahame

Microsoft was excited to work with Ohio University to develop this tool. As a consequence, Perry and Grahame were invited to attend the MS National Office Hour hosted by Microsoft where they presented to approximately 150 Microsoft staffers. A recording of this meeting may be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pWUyWNpy4o

Live chat has been something that Kelly Brought on, director of operational purchasing, has been eager to add.

“Renee and Jeremy have the curiosity and drive to explore new ideas,” Brought on said. “I told them I wanted this feature but didn’t know how to implement and within days they had started a dialogue directly with Microsoft.”

Flooding at Cathedral City mobile home park Cathedral City Council member Nancy Ross puts up caution tape during flooding at The Canyon Mobile Home Community in Cathedral City. Palm Springs Desert Sun

About 60 homes at the Canyon Mobile Home Community in Cathedral City have been impacted by flooding as of Saturday evening, according to Cathedral City Council member Nancy Ross, who also lives in the 55 and older community of 350 homes.

“On the (most impacted streets), there was in several locations at least three feet of rushing water that was like a river and had a current of its own, it’s frightening,” Ross said. “And that rushing water by nature just wanted to follow a straight path up into people’s driveways and into their garages, and so many people flooded.”

Ross says damage to the roughly 60 impacted homes includes water flooded into garages or homes, and water under the mobile homes. Ross and her husband spent the afternoon checking on neighbors and attempting to keep nearby culverts clear of debris. The Cathedral City Fire Department also came to the park this afternoon to help evacuate several people out of their homes who couldn’t get past the rushing water in the road.

“It’s a senior citizen mobile home park, many of our people are in their 80s. They just don’t deserve to be in such a vulnerable situation, that’s for sure,” said Ross.

Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage is experiencing flooding at its main facility, but videos online have made it look worse than it really is, an Eisenhower spokesperson told The Desert Sun Sunday evening.

Images and video posted online show flooding outside the John W. Larson Foundation Trauma Center. In one photo, an abandoned golf cart sits submerged in water.

But Lee Rice, the medical center’s public information officer, said that none of it has affected any patient care areas of the hospital.

“Fortunately, it hasn’t had any impact on our patient care areas,” Rice said. “So, it’s business as usual for us.”

Online videos showed the inside of Eisenhower with a small amount of water in the back hallways, with towels on the floor to absorb the moisture.

Rice said that some flooding has merely forced Eisenhower to divert ambulances to another section of the hospital that has not experienced the effects of the ongoing rainfall that has come with Tropical Storm Hilary.

Eisenhower is in its slower time of year, which is typical during the summer months, Rice said. She added that it has helped Eisenhower avoid any serious challenges during the storm.

Earlier Sunday, Eisenhower closed urgent care facilities in Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and La Quinta but left Emergency Department services open and available to the community as needed.

All schools will be closed Monday in two of the Coachella Valley's three districts, Desert Sands Unified and Palm Springs Unified.

In Coachella Valley Unified School District, the first day of the school year will be Thursday.

Xavier College Preparatory High School also said it will be closed Monday, although staff will try to come to campus to assess any damage caused by the storm. The school said it is anticipating some minor damage caused by flooding and leaks.

College of the Desert will also be closed on Monday, although classes for the new semester are not set to begin until next week. College of the Desert ""currently has a lot of water and debris on site,"" and the Palm Desert campus has also ""experienced some water intrusion in key areas.""

School officials are asking everyone to remain off campus, and ""no business will be conducted at any location, except COD’s Maintenance Team and Campus Safety Team, who will help assess the damage and determine any challenges to student or work spaces."" Regular business is expected to resume on Tuesday.

Palm Springs City Manager Scott Stiles has declared a local emergency because of the storm, city spokesperson Amy Blaisdell said.

She said the declaration opens up access to extra resources, such as funds for repairs from storm damage and more flexibility with emergency purchases.

City law gives the manager the authority to proclaim a local emergency, but it must be ratified by the city council within seven days, or it becomes invalid.

More roads are closing across the Coachella Valley as police advise residents not to drive. Closures were being announced frequently; below is only a partial list:

Palm Springs: Police announced the closure of two more roads in Palm Springs. Farrell Drive was closed between Ramon Road and Mesquite Road.

El Cairo Road was also closed at Mesquite Avenue, while the Dinah Shore Bridge is closed from Palm Springs to Cathedral City. Golf Club Drive is also closed at the Whitewater Wash.

Indian Canyon Drive, Gene Au try Trail and Vista Chino were already closed at the washes.

Cathedral City: Cathedral Canyon Drive and Dinah Shore Drive were also closed by Cathedral City Police. Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive was already closed.

East valley: 66th Street was closed between Van Buren Street and Jackson Street. Box Canyon Road from Interstate 10 to the American Canal was closed in the Mecca area.

Even in areas where roads weren't fully closed, conditions were treacherous. Just after 4 p.m., two of the three eastbound lanes of Highway 111 were closed due to rocks in the road at the Cathedral City-Rancho Mirage border.

Palm Springs Police Lt. Gustavo Arabia advised residents to avoid travel in the city unless absolutely necessary and to drive with extreme caution if they must.

“We don’t need collisions tying up resources,” he said.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom stopped in Palm Springs on Sunday as Tropical Storm Hilary wrecked havoc on the Coachella Valley. He met with Palm Springs city council members and staff in the city’s emergency operations center.

Newsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California on Saturday to support the Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.

The city posted photos of the visit on its Facebook page Sunday, explaining that city staff updated the governor on the city’s storm preparations while Newsom offered “whatever assistance he could provide to the city.” The post noted that Newsom had been instrumental in bringing Oakland Urban Search and Rescue and Swift Water California YES Task Force teams to Palm Springs,"" where they were going to be used to assist with rescues during the storm.

They also discussed the city's request for an elevated bridge on North Indian Canyon Drive over the Whitewater Wash. The Coachella Valley Association of Governments has been trying to secure funding for such a bridge, which would reduce the need for rain and wind-related closures.

Photos show Newsom adding his name to the Emergency Operations Center sign-in sheet during his visit. Palm Springs Mayor Grace Garner, City Council member Lisa Middleton, City Manager Scott Stiles, Police Chief Andrew Mills and Fire Chief Paul Alvarado are pictured meeting with Newsom during the visit.

Heavy rain has moved through the Coachella Valley and brought soaking rains that have flooded many streets and intersections. Here are the latest rain totals from the National Weather Service as of 2 p.m., with rain still falling.

Palm Desert 1.18 inches

Cathedral Canyon 1 inch

Thermal airport 0.91 inches

Palm Springs Airport 0.89 inches

Lower Tahiti Creek 0.86 inches

The National Weather Service in San Diego has issued Flash Flood Warnings for most of the Coachella Valley until 5 p.m. Sunday.

Some locations that will experience flash flooding include Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, Indio, Coachella, Thermal, La Quinta, Mecca and the Santa Rosa Mountain.

At 1:51 p.m., Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated heavy rain falling across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 to 1 inch in 1 hour. Hourly rainfall rates in Palm Desert have exceeded 0.75 inches per hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.

At 1:40 p.m., Doppler radar indicated heavy rain across the warned area. Rainfall rates of three-quarters of an inch per hour are occurring.

Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly. The weather service warns life-threatening flash flooding is possible from heavy rain, particularly of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.

Motorists should turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.

The Coachella Valley remains under a tropical storm warning on Sunday morning, and a flood watch is in effect until 5 p.m. on Monday. Light rain is falling at Palm Springs International — as of 8 a.m., 0.32 inches had fallen since midnight — and the temperature is a cool 78 degrees with 88% humidity and 6-mph winds out of the southwest, according to the National Weather Service.

But more rain, and heavier wind, is on the way. Thunderstorms are in the forecast throughout the day, with an additional two to four inches of rain expected in the valley, along with wind gusts of up to 40 to 50 mph. Temps are expected to top out at 86 degrees.

NWS Meteorologist Adam Rose said the biggest threat in the Coachella Valley is ""definitely flash flooding.""

""Many of the mountain roads going into the valley are very vulnerable,"" he said. ""As are any of those that go over those washes and things like that.

Rose said most of the rain will fall in heavy bands that could potentially produce 2 inches of rain an hour in the afternoon. There also remains a small chance of tornadoes in the valley, he said.

""With tropical storm systems, any tornadoes are usually weak and brief, but the storm prediction center does have around a 5% chance of a tornado occurring in the area,"" he said.

The rain and wind will likely be finished by the time most people are waking up on Monday morning, Rose said.

The now-downgraded Tropical Storm Hilary made landfall along Mexico's Baja California coast Sunday as concerns mounted over the storm causing what could be deadly flash flooding in the border city of Tijuana, Southern California and places as far north as Idaho that rarely get such heavy rain.

Hilary hit the coast in a sparsely populated area about 150 miles south of Ensenada.

The storm has already caused flooding in places across Mexico’s arid peninsula and threatens to unleash torrential rains on mudslide-prone Tijuana, where many improvised houses cling to steep hillsides just south of the U.S. border.

Forecasters warned the storm could cause extreme flooding, mudslides and even tornadoes. Parts of the U.S. Southwest could be hit with once-in-a-century rains and there is a good chance Hilary could break all-time records as the wettest known tropical cyclone to douse Nevada, Oregon and Idaho.

As of 11 a.m. Pacific time, Hilary was located about 215 miles south-southeast of San Diego, the National Hurricane Center reported. Hilary had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and was moving northwest at 25 mph.

The Mexican cities of Ensenada and Tijuana, directly in the storm’s path, closed all beaches and opened a half-dozen shelters at sports complexes and government offices.

Organizers of Splash House said the Palm Springs pool party and music festival will go on Sunday despite Tropical Storm Hilary's expected inundation of the Coachella Valley and the rest of Southern California.

Earlier in the weekend, the festival had been moved inside at the three hotels where it's held, which are miles apart.

""We're going to keep it real with you — we're not big fans of today's projected weather,"" organizers wrote in an Instagram post about 10 a.m. Sunday. ""But we are big fans of keeping this party going safely. Let's take things inside and close out this weekend in unprecedented style!""

Events will be at the Renaissance,  Resort and Saguaro Palm Springs hotels between about 1 p.m. and 9 p.m., according to an online schedule.

""Shuttles with run as planned between hotels,"" the Instagram post said, without addressing the possible heavy rain — predicted to be as much as two inches an hour at times Sunday afternoon.

Local and national officials, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have advised people to stay indoors and off the roads during the storm.

Later, organizers seemingly acknowledged the storm could make it hard for festival attendees from out of town to drive or fly out as scheduled. They posted a list of hotels that were offering late checkout and discounted rates for extending stays.

Ahead of the anticipated impacts from now Tropical Storm Hilary, a majority of airlines have canceled flights in and out of Palm Springs International Airport on Sunday.

As of 9 a.m., only five of 15 flight arrivals through 6 p.m were still scheduled. United, American and Wester all canceled flights into the airport. Southwest Airlines canceled its entire Sunday schedule at the airport a day earlier.

Delta’s flight from Salt Lake City to Palm Springs that arrives at 12:18 p.m. Sunday was one of the few still scheduled.

Eight of 10 evening flight arrivals into Palm Springs were still scheduled, as were several evening departures, but airport officials cautioned anyone flying to check ahead with their airline before arriving at the airport.

The National Weather Center in Miami said in the most recent advisory at 2 a.m. that Hurricane Hilary was about 30 miles south of Junta Eugenia, Mexico, and 385 miles from San Diego, California. The maximum sustained wind speed remained unchanged at 85 mph while spreading “heavy rains” northward over the peninsula.

Meteorologists warned that despite weakening, the storm remained treacherous. Forecasters said the storm was still expected to enter the history books as the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, bringing flash floods, mudslides, isolated tornadoes, high winds and power outages.

Elizabeth Adams, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service San Diego office, said rain could fall up to 3 inches an hour across the desert and mountains surrounding the Coachella Valley and beyond from late Sunday morning into the afternoon. The intense rainfall during those hours could cause widespread and life-threatening flash floods.

One person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalie, on the peninsula’s eastern coast, when a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream. Rescue workers managed to save four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulegé township.

It was not immediately clear whether officials considered the fatality related to the hurricane, but video posted by local officials showed torrents of water coursing through the town’s streets.

The forecast prompted authorities to issue an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, urging residents and beach goers to leave the tourist destination 23 miles off the coast.

As of 7 a.m. Sunday, rainfall totals since midnight were 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.41 inches at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in Thermal and 0.29 inches in A Thousand Palms, according to the National Weather Service.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declares State of Emergency

Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California Saturday to support the Hurricane Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.

Heavy rainfall and high winds were expected to last through Monday. At the governor's direction, there were currently more than 7,500 boots on the ground deployed to help local communities protect Californians from the impacts of Hilary.

The governor also signed an emergency proclamation in San Diego while visiting with California National Guard troops. He met with first responders and local officials, including San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. He was also in touch with federal officials, including the White House.

The Emergency Medical Services Authority has assets on standby, including California Medical Assistance Teams to augment local capacity, aid in evacuations and support medical needs in communities impacted by flooding. The EMMA was ready to assist with Ambulance Strike Teams as necessary to support local communities. The Flood Operations Center is activated and has repositioned flood-fight materials should they be needed.

Sandbag availability low, exhausted in some valley cities

Sand and sandbags are no longer available at local fire stations in Palm Desert as of Saturday afternoon. Instead, residents can find these resources at the Palm Desert Civic Center, 43-900 San Pablo Ave., Palm Desert.

Rancho Mirage ran out of sand at its distribution site at the Rancho Mirage Library & Observatory parking lot, so many people took their empty bags to a nearby empty lot to fill them with sand straight from the ground. Empty sandbags are still available for Rancho Mirage residents at Fire Station 69 at 71-751 Gerald Ford Drive. Proof of Rancho Mirage address is required.

Indian Wells announced mid-afternoon on Saturday that sandbags are no longer available from that city, and residents are encouraged to seek supplies from local home improvement stores, instead.

Hurricane Hilary: How experts say you should prepare

Two Palm Springs emergency officials have some advice for valley residents on how they can prepare their homes and themselves for the storm. The officials are Capt. Nathan Gunnel of the city fire department and Daniel Deserts, Palm Springs’ emergency management coordinator.

To protect yourself:

They said residents should make sure they have enough food and water to make it through a few days, including food that can be eaten if the power goes out.

They also recommended preparing for the power outages by charging their cellphones and making sure they have flashlights and batteries on hand. Deserts said he generally recommends using flashlights rather than candles because of the fire risks that come with candles.

In general, they said residents should be prepared to remain at home for multiple days as it will likely be unsafe to go out during the storm and roads could potentially remain closed or impassable even after it passes.

Gunnel recommended that residents make sure they know how to get out of their neighborhoods in the event the city does need to evacuate, keeping in mind that roads like Indian Canyon Drive and Gene Au try Road will likely be impassable. However, he said people should remember it is impossible to anticipate which other roads may be closed.

To protect your home:

Both Deserts and Gunnel recommend residents make use of the free sandbags Palm Springs and other cities and agencies are providing, particularly if their homes have ever experienced flooding in the past. It often makes sense to place sand bags in front of the front door or other places where water might pool, Gunnel said.

Deserts also said those with leaky roofs can put a tarp over them. However, he cautioned that it is important to try to make sure the tarp will be secured enough to withstand the strong expected winds.

Will any schools or conferences kick off 2023 without finalizing their plans for 2024 and beyond?

Nicole Auerbach, Justin Williams and Stewart Manuel break down what to watch for as leagues and schools ponder their next steps.

1. Where do the Pac-12’s final four stands?

Stanford and Cal are still holding out hope for an invitation to the ACC, which has continued to discuss expanding west to include them and/or SMU, though one league source metaphorically characterized the topic of expansion as something stashed away in a freezer, perhaps to be taken out again later but maybe not. The Athletic confirmed that heavy hitters such as Condoleezza Rice and George W. Bush have made calls to the ACC’s league office on behalf of Stanford and SMU, respectively, as Sports Illustrated first reported. One ACC source joked that it might be more effective if the politicians could send money to the league instead of calling, underscoring just how central the financial impact of expansion is to the discussion.

SMU has told the ACC it is willing to forgo its revenue distribution from the league for five years to be admitted. Stanford has broached the same subject with ACC officials, a league source confirmed to The Athletic. At the very least, the Bay Area schools would be coming in at partial shares, if they eventually joined.

But the ACC didn’t have enough support to add these schools a week ago, when the presidents and chancellors took a straw poll on expansion, needing 12 of 15 to vote yes to make it happen. Four schools were opposed: Florida State, Clemson, North Carolina and NC State. No other votes — formal or straw — have taken place since. But the ACC has also not officially tabled expansion, so the wait continues.

The wait has also put Oregon State and Washington State in a tough position. The two schools, who have hired Oliver Luck as a consultant, need to see what Stanford and Cal do before they can fully explore their limited options. If there’s a chance the four schools would remain together, they could potentially work together to rebuild the Pac-12. Oregon State AD Scott Barnes told The Athletic on Wednesday that he’s hoping to have clarity on Stanford and Cal’s paths forward soon. “If we do, then we can go to work in earnest on rebuilding the Pac-12,” Barnes said. “That’s certainly our goal. I have been personally in touch with the other schools to ensure that we’re talking and meeting and moving the ball up the field. … Obviously, (Group of 5) options are out there. But that’s not our priority.”

If the four schools stay together, they can evaluate the assets they have — the money set to come in via NCAA Tournament units, the Pac-12 Networks infrastructure, etc. — and see if it’s feasible to rebuild the league via backfilling members before deciding that they would need to go to the Mountain West or the American Athletic Conference. Barnes told The Oregonian on Wednesday that he sees a reconstituted Pac-12 as needing “eight to 10 schools to start with.”

There is a sense of urgency across the board for all four schools, though. They need to set plans for the 2024 football season, and right now they each only have six games on their schedule. They’ve got to get moving on some course of action soon, whether that’s Plan B or a Plan C … or a Plan D. — Nicole Auerbach

GO DEEPER Oregon State athletic director Scott Barnes on rebuilding the Pac-12: ‘That’s certainly our goal’

2. What’s next for the Big 12?

The moon! No, it appears that after two years of nonstop expansion chatter, the Big 12 is content to settle down with its 16 future members starting in 2024: eight incumbents and eight newcomers.

Conference commissioner Brett Earmark said “we’re done” in terms of further realignment on the “Marc hand and Our and Sports Media Podcast” earlier this week, which includes the Big 12 “no longer” considering Gonzalo and Conn. Any previous interest in  clearly focused on basketball, which Earmark believes is undervalued from a media rights perspective, but adding them became unfeasible once the Big 12 pulled off its “dream scenario” of luring the “Four Corners” schools from the Pac-12.

Earmark feels the league has successfully addressed its three “big-picture items” since he took over as commissioner in August 2022: re-upping the media-rights deal with ESPN and Fox (which now runs through 2031), negotiating an early exit for Texas and Oklahoma’s SEC departure and securing additional expansion. All of it, along with some continued uncertainty in the ACC, has positioned the Big 12 to establish itself as the third power conference behind the Big Ten and SEC.

Future ambition and disruption will never be completely off the table as long as Earmark is at the helm, but it seems the Big 12 is finally able to embrace what it has long sought: stability. — Justin Williams

3. How might the 12-team College Football Playoff change in a post-Pac-12 world with four “power” leagues instead of five?

We’ll get more clarity about the 12-team CFP and any potential changes to its format in a couple of weeks, when the commissioners meet in Dallas on Aug. 30. SEC commissioner Greg Sanka has already set the stage for the group to revisit some of the previously agreed-upon aspects of the format.

“How many FBS conferences will exist in 30 or 60 days?” Sanka said on “The Paul Firearm Show” last week. “We do have changed circumstances. Right now we still have 10 FBS conferences. But there’s obviously a great question whether that (will) remain. And yeah, that could create the thought in my mind and I think in others about some level of adjustment being made.”

Last year, the presidents who oversee the CFP officially approved the creation of a 12-team bracket, one that would include six automatic spots for the highest-ranked conference champions (in most years, the five Power 5 conference winners plus the best Group of 5 team) and six at-large teams. I expect the commissioners would discuss an adjusted model for a “Power 4” scenario that awards five automatic spots for conference champions plus seven at-larges. Others have begun discussing publicly the idea of 12 at-larges, but there are legal issues as well as questions of overall fairness that could be raised by going too far down that path.

Removing automatic qualifiers would also abandon one of the purported foundational reasons the CFP expanded from four to 12 teams: to increase access for all FBS leagues. Still, the SEC and the Big Ten are bigger than ever and will likely throw their weight around on what they want the new CFP to look like (particularly for the new contract beginning in 2026), and they will certainly want more at-large spots for their top teams.

CFP revenue, which to date has been distributed evenly among Power 5 leagues regardless of participation in the four-team field, is also expected to become an even more contentious issue in the changing landscape. Perhaps the leagues that send and advance the most teams through the postseason should get more money, similar to the way NCAA men’s basketball tournament units work. The size of the conferences will also likely factor into the calculations; if shares remain equal, the 18-team Big Ten would pay out less money to each of its schools than the SEC dividing its share 16 ways and the ACC sharing its money 14 ways. Options to adjust that dynamic will also be explored. — Auerbach

4. What are the TV-related deadlines and negotiation windows to watch for the realignment carousel to start back up again?

If the “Pac-12” goes away, the other major conferences’ contracts won’t come up again for some time. The Big Ten’s new deal with Fox, CBS and NBC that begins this year runs through 2030, the Big 12’s with ESPN and Fox runs from 2025 through 2031, the SEC’s with ESPN runs through 2034 and the ACC’s with ESPN runs through 2036.

If the Pac-4 does stay together and expands, it would face a frantic rush to solicit bids and sign a deal for games that begin almost exactly a year from now. The potential money wouldn’t come close to the $25 million-per-school Apple was prepared to guarantee the Pac-12 before it blew up. But depending on which teams the league adds, the number should easily eclipse the Mountain West’s current deal with Fox and CBS, which pays just $4 million per school and runs through 2025-26. In fact, it may be a way for ESPN to retain a West Coast presence on the cheap.

It’s unclear who would lead the negotiations, though. Barnes told John Canoeing this week, “(Pac-12 commissioner) George (Kickoff) has not been involved in our path forward.”

Extracting actionable insights from this data can be overwhelming and time-consuming.

Microsoft Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool that empowers users to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations and interactive reports. In this article, we will delve into the basics of Microsoft Power BI and guide you through the process of harnessing its capabilities to unlock the full potential of your data.

Understanding Microsoft Power BI

A cloud-based business analytics application, Microsoft Power BI is made to connect, process and visualize data rapidly and effectively. It provides a user-friendly interface that enables data manipulation for both expert and non-technical users without the need for complex coding knowledge. The tool is a popular option for organizations all around the world because of its smooth connection with other Microsoft products, such as Excel and Azure.

In Power BI Desktop, there are three views available to users:

Report view: Users can utilize their custom queries to construct visually appealing representations, arrange them as desired, and create multipage reports that can be shared with others.

Data view: This view provides a display of the report data in a data model format. Users can add measures, create new columns, and manage relationships between data elements.

Model view: Users can access a graphical representation of the established relationships in the data model. Additionally, they have the option to manage and modify these relationships as necessary.

Getting started with Power BI

Data source connection

The first step is to connect Power BI to your data sources. It supports various data sources, including Excel spreadsheets, databases, cloud services and online platforms, such as Google Analytics. Once connected, Power BI will automatically refresh the data to ensure your reports are always up-to-date.

Data transformation and modeling

One might need to tidy up and format the data before they can visualize it. One can easily filter, sort, pivot and merge data tables using Power BI’s Power Query Editor. Furthermore, one can also create connections between various tables using the Data Modeling tool to facilitate in-depth research.

Creating interactive reports and dashboards using Power BI

Data visualization

With the data ready, Power BI’s rich collection of data visualization tools comes into play. One can create compelling charts, graphs, maps and tables that represent complex data in a comprehensible manner. The extensive library of customizable visuals ensures one finds the perfect representation for specific needs.

Building dashboards

Power BI dashboards are user-friendly one-page displays of visualizations and reports. One can combine different visual elements to create a holistic view of the data, making it easy to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and track business metrics in real-time.

Report publishing and sharing

After creating insightful reports and dashboards, one can publish them to the Power BI service. This cloud-based sharing platform allows users to securely share visualizations with colleagues, stakeholders or clients. Moreover, one can set up automatic data refresh schedules to keep the reports up-to-date.

Power BI’s advanced features and data analysis capabilities

Data analysis expressions

The data analysis expressions (DAX) language is a powerful formula language used in Power BI for data manipulation and calculations. By mastering DAX, one can create complex measures, calculated columns and tables that go beyond the built-in aggregation functions.

Additionally, DAX queries can be generated and executed using various tools, including SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and open-source applications, such as DAX Studio. Unlike DAX calculation formulas, which are limited to tabular data models, DAX queries can also be executed against Analysis Services Multidimensional models. DAX queries are commonly preferred due to their ease of writing and higher efficiency compared to Multidimensional Data Expressions (MDX) queries.

A DAX query resembles a statement, similar to a SELECT statement in T-SQL. The simplest form of a DAX query is an “evaluate” statement, as shown in the example below:

Many readers may already be familiar with chatbots, which are software applications that simulate human conversation via text or voice interactions. The “GPT” in Chat GPT stands for Generative Pre-training Transformer; it is a large language model (LLM) that is trained to create text that is intelligible to humans. It depends on a form of machine learning (ML) that trains neural networks to recognize patterns and make connections in data. (See Evident Dived, “How Chat GPT Will Impact Accounting,” Data Driven Investor, April 5, 2023, https://bit.ly/3CLZzSB.)

AI chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to interact with humans; they use unstructured inputs to develop their own logic. An AI “bot” technology that can automate rule-based and standardized tasks is called Robotic Process Animation (RPA), which can process data and complete transactions using structured logic and inputs. The integration of chatbots and RPA can perform specific tasks in response to a query, providing more comprehensive results.

This month’s column takes a look at some introductory Chat GPT resources for CPA's who would like to learn more about this automation toolbox.

Pop Automation (https://www.popautomation.com/) is a commercial firm that provides software applications to automate and streamline digital business reporting processes. It supports OpenAI’s Chat GPT, Altered, and many popular Microsoft products. Its website provides a large collection of articles with step-by-step screenshots on a variety of technologies commonly used by accountants, such as Excel, Power BI, and, of course, Chat GPT. Readers who are not (yet) interested in using Chat GPT will find many handy “how-to” and best practices articles on common software applications. Pop Automation’s website presents several excellent detailed blog posts on Chat GPT, with visual aids and links to outside resources. “How Chat GPT will Impact Accounting” (https://bit.ly/44aykNl) illustrates how Chat GPT can record a journal entry, answer financial questions, automate financial reporting, use Microsoft Excel to complete tasks, perform (initial) tax research, and input data into Quick-Books. Pop Automation predicts that Chat GPT will replace transactional accounting and low-level computer programming, but it does not currently recommend using Chat GPT to prepare income tax returns. It also discusses several limitations, which could be summarized as “garbage in, garbage out” (GIGO), and it explains why Chat GPT will not replace accountants. “How to Use Chat GPT for Financial Analysis” (https://bit.ly/3XhEQQ2) demonstrates how to use Chat GPT with horizontal analysis, vertical analysis, and financial ratio analysis. It can summarize or edit financial statement disclosures. Accountants who are familiar with Excel and Power BI can pair Chat GPT with these analytical tools. Chat GPT can be used to simplify forecasting techniques, generating as much or as little detail as desired. The Pop Automation “how to” blog posts cover using Chat GPT with the wide variety of software applications that the company supports, in particular, many Microsoft applications. Although Microsoft is discussed in more detail below, readers might find “What is Microsoft Copilot 365” (https://bit.ly/3NHVjdt) to be a nice preliminary introduction. Microsoft Copilot 365 will allow non-technical users to employ more powerful software applications. Chat GPT is quite useful for creating or troubleshooting Excel formulas, as highlighted in “How to Use Chat GPT with Excel” (https://bit.ly/43IHAbL). It can also generate commonly used Excel templates, such as invoices; with small data sets, it can copy and paste e-mail templates. Chat GPT can consolidate multiple Excel spreadsheets into one.

Will a $2 Power ball ticket make you a millionaire? In a week, the jackpot shot up from $215 million to $291 million.

One month after someone in California won the Power ball jackpot for $1.08 billion and almost two weeks after someone in Neptune Beach, Florida, won the largest Mega Millions' jackpot in the history of the game at $1.58 billion, this latest Power ball jackpot has been steadily climbing. In a matter of weeks, the grand prize has increased from $20 million to the current pot. The upward trajectory continued after the Saturday, Aug. 19, drawing rolled over again.

Saturday's numbers were 1-25-27-38-62 and the Power ball was 13. Power Play was 2x. The jackpot climbed from $264 million to $291 million. The next chance to win is Monday, Aug. 21.

In case you're wondering, Wednesday, Aug. 16, numbers were 9-11-17-19-55 and the Power ball was 1. Power Play was 2x. There was one big winning ticket from Wednesday night − a ticket purchased in Massachusetts won a $1 million prize with a Match 5.

On July 19, a single ticket in California matched all five numbers plus the Power ball to win $1.08 billion, the largest jackpot since the record-setting $2.04 billion in November. On Aug. 8, a single ticket purchased at a Publix in Neptune Beach, Florida, matched all five numbers plus the Power ball to win $1.58 billion. Neither billion-dollar lottery jackpot has been claimed.

Like Mega Millions, Power ball tickets start at $2 apiece. Power ball drawings are at 11 p.m. EST Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.

Trump’s social media company announced late Wednesday that it had postponed a crucial meeting of shareholders scheduled for Thursday, at which it hoped to announce that investors had agreed to give it more time to complete its long-delayed deal.

The company is now giving shareholders until Sept. 5 to approve the measure to give it more time to complete the deal with Trump Media & Technology Group. That is just three days before the shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corp., would be forced to begin to liquidate and return the $300 million it raised from investors in a September 2021 initial public offering.

Digital World was set up as a special purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC, which raises money by going public to finance a future merger — in this case, Trump Media. The merger was announced on Oct. 21, 2021, and Digital World now is trying to get 65 percent of its roughly 400,000 shareholders — most of them retail investors — to approve the extension for the deal.

The vote to delay the liquidation date comes after Digital World reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20 to resolve an investigation into events preceding the original merger announcement. Digital World’s settlement requires it to pay a penalty of $18 million once the merger is completed and revise some of its filings to comply with federal securities laws.","The shell company is now giving shareholders until Sept. 5 to approve the measure to give it more time to complete the deal with Trump Media & Technology Group.

Incident Report

Date:08/19/2023 0432EST

Incident Summary:

A local loop of ICMP was detected in search of DNS. Further investigation unveiled an unexpected active SSH daemon (SSHD service) running on the system.

I observed multiple DNS queries (to (0–3).Debian.pool.ntp.org) originating from the local machine (127.0.0.1) targeting the same local machine. After each DNS request, there is an ICMP message indicating “Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)”. This suggests that while the machine is trying to resolve domain names, there might be an issue preventing proper responses, possibly due to a misconfiguration or a service not running.

x.Debian.pool.ntp.org is a server pool for Debian. NTP servers are used to synchronize the time of computer systems. Normally, they don’t serve web content or videos… But when I visited 2.Debian.pool.ntp.org I was redirected to the classic “Never Going to Give You Up.” video. Yes, I was Rick Rolled, yes I had a great laugh; no better way to start the early morning. This did however, mean a few things:

1. Set up for the purpose of the prank.

2. DNS Hijack.

3. Mite.

It’s unlikely for an official Debian NTP pool to be set up for a prank like Rick rolling. Systems worldwide depend on the pool.

An attacker may manipulate the DNS to point 2.Debian.pool.ntp.org to a different server instead of the legitimate NTP server. When someone tries to connect, they get Rick roll’d

On the LAN an attacker might use ARP poisoning to redirect traffic to their machine, similarly anyone could manipulate BGP routes to redirect traffic intended for the legitimate NTP servers to their own server, OR my local router /ISP’s gateway has been compromised, in which traffic is redirected to other servers

1. Initial Indication:

Unusual ICMP traffic targeted at DNS resolution was observed from the local loop. Observation was captured on Wireshark before an internet connection was established.

2. Initial Commands and Investigations:

Command Sequence:

sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p TCP — port 5037 -j DROP

Standard command executed at every startup.

Sudo SS -tune | grep 123

sudo net stat -tune | grep 123

These commands yielded no output.

Identify processes using port 123 (NTP), but nothing was found. This could mean there was no active service on port 123 at that time.

Command: nslookup 2.Debian.pool.ntp.org

This was used to resolve the NTP pool’s IP. figuring out if the DNS resolution was functioning correctly or if there was any unusual behavior from this domain. (This is where I was Rick Rolled)

SS -turned | grep 48545

net stat -turned | grep 48545

sudo net stat -turned | grep 48545

These commands aimed to detect any services or processes that were interacting with source port 48545.

Sudo net stat -turned

Result: Detected port 22 (SSH) was active.

Command: PS aux | grep 692

Identified process ID 692 was associated with the SSHD service.

Log Analysis:

Various grep commands on /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/syslog, etc.

Result: No logs related to “Server listening on” were found in the specified files.

T’s unusual for no logs to be present. Possible explanations include logs being manually cleared, misconfigurations preventing log generation, or logs being rotated out and archived.

Command: ls /var/log

This was done to check the available logs on the system.

Command: sudo journalist -u ssh. Service | grep “Server listening on”

Result: Discovered SSH had been starting at boot since August 11.

Command: sudo NATO /etc/hosts

Result: An old IP address from  was uncommented. It was then commented out to correct this.

Sudo system status SSHD

sudo system stop SSHD

sudo system status SSHD

Result: Identified that the SSHD service was active. The service was then stopped and rechecked to confirm it was no longer running.

Command: CD /home/Kali/.msf4/logs/ followed by a review of the logs.

Result: The logs did not reveal any relevant information.

Cat hydra. Restore

Displayed operations that were conducted, no relevant data displayed

system is-enabled SSHD

system show -p Fragmentary SSHD

cat /etc/init’d/ssh

These commands were executed to understand the configuration, script path, and current status of the SSHD service.

Sudo system disable ssh. Service

Prevent ssh from start up in the future.

___________________

Since I didn’t discover any ARP packets during my Wireshark session, I’m going to assume that visiting 2.Debian.pool.ntp.org and getting Rick Rolled was a nice little Easter egg for Debian users. I still don’t know what created the ssh session and what configured it to start at boot. I also don’t know where my log files went. This incident is deferred.

About 80 different vendors from across the country made their way down to Waco to sell, trade, and show off their cards.

Chris Fernandes, who organized the show, has had the vision of a big show in Waco for the last several years. He said so far, the event has surpassed their expectations.

“It’s insane,” said Fernandes. “This is our first show, we really didn’t know how this was going to end up. Lots of foot traffic coming in and out, it’s been great. It’s been a long time waiting, but at the end of the day, our goal is to serve our vendors and or attendees as good as we can.”

Many people in the Waco community, including Brent Banks ton of Banks ton’s sports memorabilia, comics, and collectibles shop here in town, say that Waco is the perfect spot for a big show because of how easy it is to get to the city from all parts of the state.

Brent Banks ton from Banks ton's sports card shop here in Waco talks about this weekend's first Waco Card Show.

“Waco is ideal because it’s centrally located,” said Banks ton. “We’re in the heart of Texas, and right off 35 (I-35). It’s inexpensive, you can eat some great food here and have a great time. Really, we’re excited to show off Waco a little.”

The card show takes place from Friday, August 18 through Sunday the 20th, and it couldn’t have debuted in Waco at a better time. Since the surge of the card industry took off during the pandemic, the hobby has only continued to grow.

“The industry has hit all new highs of interest,” said Banks ton. “You’ve got anyone from 8-year-olds to 88-year-olds who are all excited about the industry.”

While this isn’t the first time there has been a larger show in Waco, it’s still the first time in a long time. Fernandes says he hopes to continue to grow the show and make the Waco Card Show the premiere event in the Lone Star State.

“Even to this day, since we booked out all of our tables, we are getting calls daily, adding more tables,” said Fernandes. “Our goal is to get a bigger room next time, and (autograph) signers at the next show. The growth is honestly exponential from here.”

Chris Fernandes, the man who organized the first official Waco Card Show, shares his vision on the event and his goals for the show in Waco.

Waco Card Show plans to have a series of shows throughout the year to attract even more new collectors into the hobby. Their next show is scheduled to take place in October, though a specific date and location have not yet been determined.

Fernandes also told us that this weekend, the Waco Card Show is giving a 50% discount to current Baylor students or anyone who wears Baylor gear to the show.

Barstool’s PFT Commenter thinks so.

On Friday’s edition of Pardon My Take, PFT said the NBA could do better than to just drop its regular season schedule on a random Thursday like it did last week.

“The NBA needs to learn from the NFL and know how to properly do a schedule release,” he said. “I had no idea that the NBA schedule release was today.”

PFT added typically for the NFL, you get the announcement of the date of when the schedule release will be released, the official schedule release date, then the schedule release.

Co-host Dan “Big Cat” Katz chimed in mentioning that usually in that time between the date the NFL schedule is released and the announcement of the schedule release you usually have some leaks about potential marquee matchups. He said you don’t get that with the NBA.

“Would anyone even want to leak this?” Big Cat asked.

NFL teams have had a lot of fun on social media in recent years unveiling the next season’s schedule. PFT said some dazzle dazzle from the NBA could go a long way.

“Maybe the Chargers social media team could do like an anime thing for the NBA and help them out a little,” he said. “Get some buzz going.”",Barstool's PFT commenter said the NBA could do better than drop its regular season schedule on a random Thursday like it did last week.

Other,TechCrunch,"What is a liquid neural network, really?",Brian Heater,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8xNy93aGF0LWlzLWEtbGlxdWlkLW5ldXJhbC1uZXR3b3JrLXJlYWxseS_SAU1odHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMTcvd2hhdC1pcy1hLWxpcXVpZC1uZXVyYWwtbmV0d29yay1yZWFsbHkvYW1wLw?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"The initial research papers date back to 2018, but for most, the notion of liquid networks (or liquid neural networks) is a new one. It was “Liquid Time-constant Networks,” published at the tail end of 2020, that put the work on other researchers’ radar. In the intervening time, the paper’s authors have presented the work to a wider audience through a series of lectures.

Rain Hasan’s TEDx talk at MIT is one of the best examples. Hasan is the Principal AI and Machine Learning Scientist at the Vanguard Group and a Research Affiliate at SAIL MIT, and served as the paper’s lead author.

“These are neural networks that can stay adaptable, even after training,” Hasan says in the video, which appeared online in January. When you train these neural networks, they can still adapt themselves based on the incoming inputs that they receive.

The “liquid” bit is a reference to the flexibility/adaptability. That’s a big piece of this. Another big difference is size. “Everyone talks about scaling up their network,” Hasan notes. “We want to scale down, to have fewer but richer nodes.” MIT says, for example, that a team was able to drive a car through a combination of a perception module and liquid neural networks comprised of a mere 19 nodes, down from “noisier” networks that can, say, have 100,000.

“A differential equation describes each node of that system,” the school explained last year. “With the closed-form solution, if you replace it inside this network, it would give you the exact behavior, as it’s a good approximation of the actual dynamics of the system. They can thus solve the problem with an even lower number of neurons, which means it would be faster and less computationally expensive.”

The concept first crossed my radar by way of its potential applications in the robotics world. In fact, robotics make a small cameo in that paper when discussing potential real-world use. “Accordingly,” it notes, “a natural application domain would be the control of robots in continuous-time observation and action spaces where causal structures such as LCS [Liquid Time-Constant Networks] can help improve reasoning.”

One of the benefits of these systems is that they can be run with less computing power. That means — potentially — using something as simple as a Raspberry Pi to execute complex reasoning, rather than offloading the task to external hardware via the cloud. It’s easy to see how this is an intriguing solution.

Another potential benefit is the black box question. This refers to the fact that — for complex neural networks — researchers don’t entirely understand how the individual neurons combine to create their final output. One is reminded of that famous Arthur C. Clarke quote, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” This is an oversimplification, of course, but the point remains: Not all magic is good magic.

The adage “garbage in, garbage out” comes into play here, as well. We all intuitively understand that bad data causes bad outputs. This is one of the places where biases become a factor, impacting the ultimate result. More transparency would play an important role in identifying causality. Opacity is a problem — particularly in those instances where inferred causality could be — quite literally — a matter of life or death.

Paper co-author and head of MIT SAIL, Daniela Ru's, points me in the direction of a fatal Tesla crash in 2016, where the imaging system failed to distinguish an oncoming tractor trailer from the bright sky that back dropped it. Tesla wrote at the time:

Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied. The high ride height of the trailer combined with its positioning across the road and the extremely rare circumstances of the impact caused the Model S to pass under the trailer, with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S.

Hasan says the fluid systems are “more interpretable,” due, in part, to their smaller size. “Just changing the representation of a neuron,” he adds, you can really explore some degrees of complexity you couldn’t explore otherwise.

As for the downsides, these systems require “time series” data, unlike other neural networks. That is to say that they don’t currently extract the information they need from static images, instead requiring a dataset that involves sequential data like video.

“The real world is all about sequences,” says Hasan. “Even our perception — you’re not perceiving images, you’re perceiving sequences of images,” he says. “So, time series data actually create our reality.”

I sat down with Ru's to discuss the nature of these networks, and help my creative writing-major brain understand about what the emerging technology could mean for robotics, moving forward.

TechCrunch: I get the sense that one of the motivating factors [in the creation of liquid neural networks] are hardware constraints with mobile robotic systems and their inability to run extremely complex computations and rely on these very complex neural networks.

Daniela Ru's: That is part of it, but most importantly, the reason we started thinking about liquid networks has to do with some limitations of today’s AI systems, which prevent them from being very effective for safety, critical systems and robotics. Most of the robotics applications are safety critical.

I assume most of the people who have been working on neural networks would like to do more with less if that were an option.

Yes, but it’s not just about doing more with less. There are several ways in which liquid networks can help robotic applications. From a computational point of view, the liquid networkers are much smaller. They are compact, and they can run on a Raspberry Pi and EDGE devices. They don’t need the cloud. Furthermore, they can run on the kinds of hardware platforms that we have in robotics.

We get other benefits. They’re related to whether you can understand how the machine learning system makes decisions — or not. You can understand whether the decision is going to meet some safety constraints or not. With a huge machine learning model, it is actually impossible to know how that model makes decisions. The machine learning models that are based on deep networks are really huge and opaque.

And unpredictable.

They are opaque and unpredictable. This presents a challenge, as users are unable to comprehend how decisions are made by these systems. This is really a problem if you want to know if your robot will move correctly — whether the robot will respond correctly to a perceptual input. The first fatal accident for Tesla was due to a machine learning imperfection. It was due to a perception error. The car was riding on the highway, there was a white truck that was crossing, and the perceptual system believed that the white truck was a cloud. It was a mistake. It was not the kind of mistake that a human would make. Furthermore, it’s the kind of mistake that a machine would make. In safety critical systems, we cannot afford to have those kinds of mistakes.

Having a more compact system, where we can show that the system doesn’t hallucinate, where we can show that the system is causal and where we can maybe extract a decision tree that presents in understandable human form how the system reaches a conclusion, is an advantage. These are properties that we have for liquid networks. Another thing we can do with liquid networks is we can take a model and wrap it in something we call “Barrier.” That means adding another layer to the machine learning engine that incorporates the constraints that you would have in a control barrier function formulation for control theoretic solutions for robots. What we get from Barrier is a guarantee that the system will be stable and fall within some bounds of safety.

You’re talking about intentionally adding more constraints.

Yes, and they are the kind of constraints that we see in control theoretic, model predictive control solutions for robots. There is a body of work that is developing something called “control barrier functions.” It’s this idea that you have a function that forces the output of a system within a safe region. You could take a machine learning system, wrap it with Barrier, and that filters and ensures that the output will fall within the safety limits of the system. For example, Barrier can be used to make sure your robot will not exert a force or a torque outside its range of capability. If you have a robot that aims to apply force that is bigger than what it can do, then the robot will break itself. There are examples of what we can do with Bargained and Liquid Networks. Liquid networks are exciting because they address issues that we have with some of today’s systems.

They use fewer data and less training time. They’re smaller, and they use much less inference time. Furthermore, they are provably causal. Furthermore, they have action that is much more focused on the task than other machine learning approaches. Furthermore, they make decisions by somehow understanding aspects of the task, rather than the context of the task. For some applications, the context is very important, so having a solution that relies on context is important. But for many robotic applications, the context is not what matters. What matters is how you actually do the task. If you’ve seen my video, it shows how a deep network would keep a car on the road by looking at bushes and trees on the side of the road. Whereas the liquid networks have a different way of deciding what to do. In the context of driving, that means looking at the road’s horizon and the side of the road. This is, in some sense, a benefit, because it allows us to capture more about the task.

It’s avoiding distraction. It’s avoiding being focused on every aspect of the environment.

Exactly. Furthermore, it’s much more focused.

Do these systems require different kinds and amounts of training data than more traditional networks?

In our experiments, we have trained all the systems using the same data, because we want to compare them with respect to performance after training them in the same way. There are ways to reduce the data that is needed to train a system, and we don’t know yet whether these data reduction techniques can be applied broadly — in other words, they can benefit all models. Or if they are particularly useful for a model that is formulated in the dynamical systems' formulation that we have for liquid networks.

I want to add that liquid neural networks require time series data. A liquid network solution does not work on datasets consisting of static data items. We cannot use Imagine with liquid neural networks right now. We have some ideas, but as of now, one really needs an application with time series to use liquid networks.

The methods for reducing the amount of information that we feed into our models are somehow related to this notion that there’s a lot of repetition. So not all the data items give you effective new information. There is data that brings and widens information diversity, and then there’s data that’s more of the same. For our solutions, we have found that if we can curate the datasets so that they have diversity and less repetition, then that is the fine way to move forward.

Rain [Hasan] gave a TEDx talk at MIT. One of the things he said, which makes a lot of sense on the face of it is, “bad data means bad performance.”

Garbage in, garbage out.

Is the risk of bad data heightened or mitigated when you’re dealing with a smaller number of neurons?

I don’t think it’s any different for our model than any other model. We have fewer parameters. The computations in our models are more powerful. There’s task equivalence.

If the network is more transparent, it’s easier to determine where the problems are cropping up.

Of course. And if the network is smaller, it’s easier from the point of view of a human. If the model is small and only has a few neurons, then you can visualize the performance. You can also automatically extract a decision tree for how the model makes decisions.

When you talk about causal relationships, it sounds like one of the problems with these massive neural networks is that they can connect things almost arbitrarily. They’re not necessarily determining causal relationships in each case. They’re taking extra data and making connections that aren’t always there.

The fact is that we really don’t understand. What you say sounds right, intuitively, but no one actually understands how the huge models make decisions. In a convolutional solution to a perception problem, we think that we understand that the earlier layers essentially identify patterns at small scale, and the later layers identify patterns at higher levels of abstraction. If you look at a large language model, and you ask, ‘how does it reach decisions?’ You will hear that we don’t really know. We want to understand. We want to study these large models in greater detail and right now this is difficult because the models are behind walls.

Do you see generative AI itself having a major role in robotics and robotics learning, going forward?

Yes, of course. Generative AI is extraordinarily powerful. It really put AI in everyone’s pockets. That’s extraordinary. We didn’t really have a technology like this before now. Language has become a kind of operating system, a programming language. You can specify what you want to do in natural language. You don’t need to be a rock-star computer scientist to synthesize a program. But you also have to take this with a grain of salt, because the results that are focused on code generation show that it’s mostly the boilerplate code that can be generated automatically by large language models. Still, you can have a co-pilot that can help you code, catch mistakes, basically the co-pilot helps programmers be more productive.

So, how does it help in robotics? We have been looking at using generative AI to solve complex robotics problems that are difficult to solve with our existing methods […] With generative AI you can get much faster solutions and much more fluid and human-like solutions for control than we get with model predictive solutions. I think that’s very powerful. The robots of the future will move less mechanistically. They’ll be more fluid, more humanlike in their motions. We’ve also used generative AI for design. Here we need more than pattern generation for robots.

Defined as quantifiable and objective behavioral and physiological data collected and measured by digital devices such as implantable, wearables, investible, or portables, digital biomarkers enable pharmaceutical companies to conduct studies remotely without the need for a physical site. This innovative approach is revolutionizing the way pharmaceutical firms conduct research and determine treatment effectiveness.

According to a recent industry report from Research & Markets, the global market for digital biomarkers is set for significant growth at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% during the forecast period 2022-2028. But dealing with the data produced by digital biomarkers, let alone acting on it, remains challenging. To address this issue, US pharmaceutical company Lilly decided to turn to the cloud.

“Digital biomarkers offer unique insights into patient health through the continuous and passive collection of data using wearable sensors and remote technology. However, to make the most of these, we needed a sensor cloud to aggregate large volumes of data, perform real-time monitoring of the data, and analyze results in new ways to explore potential innovations. The solution also needed to be compatible with multiple different devices, depending on what was being measured,” says Rich Carter, SVP for the digital office at Eli Lilly and Co.

Lilly’s IT team explored the marketplace for a scalable, near-term solution that aligned with the pharmaceutical’s needs. But it found no high-capacity digital data cloud on the market that went beyond ingesting and storing wearable sensor data to help deliver the necessary insights — “making a case for Lilly to flex its innovation talent and build its own proprietary solution,” Carter says.

“We built a fit-for-purpose ecosystem called Magnolia, which is a sensor cloud with full-stack capabilities to continuously ingest, visualize, and transform a large amount of real-time wearable sensor signals from Lilly’s connected trials into meaningful digital measures,” says Carter.

The resulting platform, created over the past three years by an agile, cross-functional team bringing together a range of expertise, has earned Eli Lilly and Company a 2023 US CIO 100 Award for innovation and IT leadership.",Digital biomarkers enable pharmaceutical companies to conduct research remotely without the need for a physical site.

Following an introduction to the topic by Blake Oliver, CPA, who specializes in accounting technology and is the founder and CEO of Earmark CPE, and co-host of the Cloud Accounting Podcast, the discussion was moderated by Dan Hood, editor-in-chief of Accounting Today, while CPA Practice Advisor’s editor-in-chief Gail Perry, CPA, joined as a panelist, and its managing editor, Isaac O’Bannon, observed.

Over the last year, the hottest topic of discussion among accounting professionals has been about how artificial intelligence will shape professional firms. While AI has been a topic of sci-fi conversations and novels for several decades and has been in the popular lexicon almost as long, the actual application of such technologies into daily workflows had never really been tangible until the release of generative applications such as Catgut for automatic generation of text, and similar visual and audio production tools.

In a KPMG study in spring 2023, the Big 4 firm found that 77% of its business client respondents expected generative AI to have the largest impact on their businesses of all emerging technologies. However, 92% of them believe that implementing AI will introduce moderate to high-risk concerns.

For a profession as risk averse as accounting, what can we gather from this? To start, Blake Oliver, who recently presented on AI and the Profession during the Expansion conference in Italy, noted that a paper produced by Catgut parent company Open AI suggests that the accounting profession is one of the most exposed to generative AI.



“This means that the time it takes to do 100% of our tasks could be reduced by 50% or more,” via use of generative AI, he said. “That’s a pretty bold statement of productivity savings.” Oliver also noted, however, that there are many areas where Catgut is not that adept, particularly focused on human interaction and areas of subjectivity. Whereas it excels at data-driven and analytical functions.

Oliver then asked how many of the panelists have used Catgut, and how often. All the participants noted they have tried it, and 25% claimed to use it on a daily basis. The primary tasks they or their clients use generative AI for generally include:

social media posts

report summaries

JASON exports

financial analysis

business planning

Per an article in The Wall Street Journal, further examples of the current frequent use of generative AI for business financial purposes also include:

questions on earnings calls

transcript analysis

internal guidelines

transfer pricing

budget and actual variances

first draft of journal entries

reports, documents and presentations

footnotes to financials

auditing GL transactions

Avalara surveyed the influencers on their opinion and usage of generative AI, and 53% said they are currently using the technology for generating generic text for marketing, internal communications, policies and other functions. Other top functions they are using AI for include data analysis, scheduling and art. About a third said they are not currently using the technology but are exploring it.

Summarizing the survey data he’s seen regarding the current and pending state of generative AI adoption, Oliver noted that 50% of executives stated they are currently using AI in their finance and tax departments already, and 29% say they have plans to do so in the next year. “That means about 90% are already or expect to be using AI for finance and tax in the next 6-12 months, and the remaining respondents expect to use it in the near future.”

“There are, of course, concerns over accuracy, and hopefully ways to mitigate that, and we’ll discuss those today in the panel,” said Oliver. “But I think AI is very exciting and this is a potential solution to the accounting talent crisis caused by declining numbers of graduates, and the increased need for more accountants.”

“AI has potential to save accounting. The reason we work long hours is that computers haven’t delivered the productivity advances we were promised. We’ve just taken a lot of these paper-based processes and digitized them, but still have to do the same work.”

“Generative AI has the potential to give us the productivity boost we’ve been looking for, especially in audit and tax.” ~ Blake Oliver, CPA.

Hood then led the panelists into discussion, first clarifying the various types of AI, including generative language models like Catgut, as well as other models focused more on math, and forms of AI geared more toward audio or visual output.

In the survey of round table participants, nearly half of them believe generative AI tools will be used on a daily basis by most people in firms within the next 1-2 years. About a quarter of participants think that will happen within a year, while others forecast it will take at least three years.

Hood then suggested a “lightning round” discussion on, “What things do you think we could use AI for? Not limited to accounting, but in any field,” and noted some tasks that he sees as pretty obvious, such as engagement letters, social media posts, and running schedules.

“I recently saw an ad for an app that will analyze your email and your calendar to optimize the things that you have to do, based on prior behaviors. I think that will be a huge productivity boost,” said NATO Carter-Gray, an EA and founder of the Baltimore firm 1st Step Accounting. “It will also be a big help for work-life balance and free up some brain power.”

Hood added that such an activity analysis could be useful in other areas, such as determining the areas that an individual needs to focus more on, in terms of work processes or personal life goals.

Tamara Level, a partner at , noted that her advisory firm is implementing the work management solution Monday.com, and says they’ve been impressed with the AI built into that system, and efficiencies gained, such as being able to pull data from disparate business systems to improve project management, scheduling and coordination. “Plus, some of those routine tasks, the system is suggesting to us how to automate them,” she said.

“One of the ways I’ve found that I like to use Catgut is to research something I don’t know,” said Shayna Chapman, CPA, founder of the West Virginia accounting firm Shayna LLC. “I’m mostly taxed, bookkeeping and accounting, and don’t do much A&A work. So, I don’t need specific FAST footnotes and things that go into audit and financial statements, or how they should be specifically presented. Catgut helps me see and understand how these things should be done. It also helps if you have a short attention span on some topics, it helps ADHD people get more organized and get started with managing tasks and getting organized.

“I’ve worked in large and small firms, and they all struggle with breaking down technical financial information into layman’s language for their clients,” said Gail Perry, a CPA and editor-in-chief of CPA Practice Advisor. “I would think that this would be a good place to use Catgut or another generative AI.”

Diane Better, founder and president of the Sales Tax Institute, is using the technology for course development, stating that it is much faster and good at summarizing information. However, she noted that she’s leery of allowing the AI systems to have access to proprietary information like her emails.

Caleb Jenkins, an EA with RJL Financial, said he loves generative AI for “anything of a communicative nature,” and shared how he’s using it for several routine tasks, including creating custom out-of-office messaging.

“AI is very important and an area of continued investment for Avalara. We’ve already used AI to make transformative headway in areas like document management and tax research,” said Son Akkadian, CPA, global head of strategic accounting partnerships for Avalara. Not that long ago, she says that tax technology companies had large staffs of attorneys and CPA's who each had a jurisdiction to research. “With the local levels, it required personal relationships within those jurisdictions because websites weren’t kept updated. So it was a very manual process to keep tax databases up to date. We now use AI to streamline the tax research maintenance, and there is less labor required and improved accuracy.”

On the academic front, Annette Ellen, CPA, CGMA, Esq., a professor in and director of San Jose State University’s graduate tax program, noted that she cautions firms to fully explain their policies regarding AI when it comes to new hires, particularly when it comes to confidentiality and other issues.

“In talking to my graduate students about it, I was surprised by what they thought were the good and bad points, and that some hadn’t explored it at all.” She suggests they consider using AI as similar to speaking with a colleague. Ask it a question, and don’t take it as the final word on the matter, but as an additional point of information, an additional resource. “But you are still responsible for figuring out if the information is correct or not.”

“The way I look at AI is that it’s kind of like DOS, a command line. But we’re really at the beginning of a revolution. The start of another wave of change, and that’s why there’s a little hesitation and fear,” said Peter Wen, CPA, the founder and CEO of Tally for. “The challenge will be ‘what is the interface going to be?’ Right now you have to learn how to use it, but asking it questions can still be difficult. Our job on the technology side is to make the interface more user-friendly, to make it more like the Windows of Catgut. So that’s what Tally for has been working on.”

W. Michael CSU, CPA, founder of CFO consultancy Deeply added his thoughts on the quality of the information obtainable from generative AI systems.

“I’ve spent 400-500 hours on Catgut since it came out last year, and it does tremendous things, but the issue is how do you get the knowledge out,” he said. “And once you get the answers, you have to have the knowledge to identify when it gets some things wrong. You have to be knowledgeable on the topic to get the most out of it.”

“Generative AI is only as good as the user themselves.” ~ W. Michael CSU, CPA.

The group collectively agreed that AI will not replace accountants, although it may replace some tasks, and as CSU noted, those professionals who embrace it earlier and become more adept at its use will elevate themselves far above the abilities of those who do not become as proficient.

What Else Can AI Do?

Dan Hood then led the group towards discussion of other areas that generative and other forms of AI may be adaptable to, or may already being implemented in.

“In addition to text-based generative AIs like Catgut, there are other models specifically tuned to math, imagery and other formats,” he noted. “So, looking beyond Catgut, are there other applications that are not prompt-driven, meaning you ask it a question or give it a command? Are there any that you can just point at a collection of data, images, or other content, and tell it to absorb it and report?”

NATO Carter-Gray noted the use of AI in scanning medical imaging to find correlations and trends, which can be useful in diagnoses and treatments.

Blake Oliver referenced chat-based customer service companies, many of whom have developed their own support databases and systems that list pre-canned responses based on customer need, with agents able to select the one appropriate to the situation.

“This would be a natural use of Catgut, where it could automatically send one of those responses based on customer questions or comments.” He suggested this could also apply to accounting firm client service, too. For instance, when a client emails asking for a tax return or financial statement. AI could find that information and send it to them via secure portal.”

Diane Better sees potential for the use of AI in sales tax processes. “From a sales tax perspective, we’ve heard of more bot-based AI pulling invoices to support an audit. Some challenges on filing returns include how often states change their websites and portals. Can we now get the AI to read the invoices and analyze if the transactions are what they say they are, and whether they are taxable? This is a time-consuming area of sales tax audits that I’d love to see AI do.”

Caleb Jenkins noted a company named Digits, which has been doing the predictive side of analytics using AI tools and has combined that with generative AI as well. This lets them connect to GL sets to automatically recommend and suggest cleaning up transactions.

Randy Johnston, the founder of Network Management Group, Inc. and executive VP of K2 Enterprises, noted some interesting applications of AI have included the use by a farm support group that has implemented chatbots and reduced human support contact by half. “The amount of cost-savings on chat support agents alone is pretty stunning.” He further noted that “building AI into technology platforms is a big deal.”

“We’ve seen AI around for a very long time. The bigger part we’re going to see as we get better, and tighter integration is actually being able to control the content and the data that’s being researched,” said Dan Luther, CPA, a partner at Ignite Spot Accounting. “I think that’s one of the things that will make a massive change in the evolution of AI for us as accounting professionals and also for consumers.”

“The biggest struggle right now is that it’s using a huge database that it’s evaluating from, which creates a difficult context for value-driven functions,” he added. “It’s the reason why AI art is so skewed, it’s looking at Monet, and da Vinci, and others, and fingers are different in all of them. It’s the same thing when it comes to creating communication for a client or evaluating financials.”

Luther referenced a session at the 2023 AICPA Engage conference that discussed the topic of setting the database for generative AI to research, instead of having it use the generic data bank that Catgut and current consumer models use, which is essentially all website information prior to 2021.

What are the biggest opportunities for AI in accounting?

Dan Hood then directed participants to consider what functions they see professionals benefiting from with AI in the current, near or more distant future, whether they are “pie in the sky” dreams or more realizable.

“AI is going to be great for training,” said NATO Carter-Gray. “These how-to AI’s can hold large data sets that can teach, maintain formulas, or help staff remember how to do certain tasks. It will free up our brain power, freeing us from a lot of tedious work, and spending that time with clients and on more profitable functions. If we can have the AI doing forecasts and other projections, we can use that to further our client relationships.”

Hood agreed with these points, noting that AI-based training will also further enable more organizations to take advantage of remote workforce, since training won’t be exclusively an in-office function. These training databases could be built in-house by firms, or via adoption of best practices that could be developed by professional societies and vendors.

When asked what the first impactful uses of generative AI in accounting firms will be, attendees were basically split into three groups, with equal numbers suggesting automating data analysis, marketing functions, and handling client communications.

Caleb Jenkins sees a near-future benefit coming when multiple apps are integrated with AI, so that it can pull data from whatever systems are necessary, and then auto-respond to client requests, or help generate forecasts, financials, and other communications. “This may be a few years, but I’m currently using it for proposal follow-ups, with details of all of their services stored in Catgut, so that these routine client communications can be handled more easily.”

“I think AI will give us a new service line. People are willing to pay for our expertise, and we will be able to facilitate more projects for clients, as well as opportunities that we may be hesitant to take on now,” said Nicole Davis, founder and principal at Butler–Davis Tax & Accounting, LLC. “I think it will help us better provide advisory services, in ways that can be scaled to any size firm.”

Dan Luther noted that he sees some things that should be very simple for AI to do, even with today’s technology, but would be very useful for accountants if they could be automated.

“How amazing would it be to have your bank feeds re-evaluating against data out on the market, to see how others have coded similar transactions from the same or similar vendors, and having transactions automatically classified,” he said, adding that the data would then be confirmed with the client. “That’s a super basic, simple function that would be really valuable in cutting down the back and forth between the firm and clients.”

From a business development and growth perspective, Tamara Level sees firm partners being able to use AI to better analyze their own clients. “I know some firms are doing this to look at cross-selling opportunities, proposing additional services, and even generating communications touchpoints to better serve clients and customize their experience.”

“This may be a pie-in-the-sky hope, but how great would it be to never hear another word about Excel? Ever. No articles. No clients using it, it’s gone. That would free up so much time for accountants all over the world,” said Amy Better, CPA, CGMA, CEO of The B3 Method Institute and Drastic Yoga.

Mark Koziol, CPA, president and CEO of Alluvial Global, was the last to comment on the coming applications of AI for firms, noting that Dan Luther’s hoped-for AI automation and integration of bank feeds is already starting. “There is a company called Audit Sight that is doing a lot with bank feeds to automate a lot of the audit steps around receivables and inventory, and we already have several of our firms using it. The next step is to bring this technology into the client accounting space.”

Data Security, Copyright and Other Concerns

Among professionals, security and ownership of data uploaded into Catgut is a highly watched topic, as there are questions as to who then legally owns or has the right to use that data.

“As a company that produces content, that we copyright, I wonder how you control your copyright if someone else puts your copyrighted information into a generative chat platform?” said Diane Better. “Is copyright protection a thing of the past?”

NATO Carter-Gray said that she stresses data security with her clients, and this is another area where she will need to advise clients to be safe. “My biggest concern is people using Catgut sites to produce works and then selling them, even though the items were created with AI-generated data or images, that were basically sampled by other people. Additionally, will the generative AI companies come forward in the future and claim ownership of the works produced with their systems?” She also voiced concern over whether use of AI will have an effect on firm insurance as it regards data security.

Dan Hood agreed with the data ownership concerns posited by Carter-Gray, and noted that firms need to start developing rules for how their staff use the systems, from data input, through use of the output information. Further, he suggested users treat the output as additional research from which they can reference or use to create their own unique content, much as they might with a reference book like an encyclopedia.

Kelly Phillips Era, a tax and finance writer for Forbes, noted that Sarah Silverman is suing Catgut and Meta for using her book in their training manuals. She said that she had never consented to this use, which has now been disseminated via the systems. Blake Oliver noted in the roundtable’s accompanying chat discussion that the U.S. Copyright Office has ruled generative AI output is not protected.

Shayna Chapman noted she is concerned about the vulnerability to cyber-attacks, and the location/country where data is being stored, and whether that information would have to be disclosed to clients. “At this point, I’m not putting any client identifying information into these systems. I just don’t know what I don’t know yet.”

“We’ve used AI in a lot of situations to create efficiencies and to automate processes,” said Jenny M. Guitar, CPA, partner and business outsourcing practice leader at EIDE Billy. “One of the obstacles we’ve found is people just going through the motions of doing processes, and not understanding the why. There’s been a disconnect between the learning aspect and really understanding. So how do we get our teams to really understand, and get AI to help us increase the learning and understanding of processes?”

“Catgut is powerful, and it’s probably here to stay. It is critical for firms to develop guidelines on the use. What concerns me is the risk of staff using it as a source of truth without validation and internal policies or guidelines,” said Son Akkadian. “The accounting profession also has to address privacy, confidentiality, and integrity. That’s why Avalara is implementing policies to give employees guidelines on how and when to use the technology. Firms need to develop similar guidelines.”

To What Extent Do Accounting Firm Leaders Need to be Concerned About AI?

Dan Hood then moved the discussion toward the day-to-day issues that firm leaders will face with AI, noting that adoption by the profession may be similar to its adoption of the cloud. Some firms moving into it more intentionally, while others took a gradual and hesitant approach as the technologies that they used started to include cloud components or evolved into web-based systems. In the end, almost all firms are now mostly in the cloud, whether they took intentional action to go there.

With AI, Hood questioned how active firms will need to be in adopting the systems, or whether the functions will end up being integrated into the existing tax, accounting and business applications they already use. “How much will firms need to proactively adopt, and when, and over what time frame?”

Dan Luther suggested that the pace of change in the technologies, and the scope of capabilities and adoption will change dramatically even in the short term.

“The biggest thing to me is there needs to be better education on creating the prompts [that staff use to direct the AI systems], and firm owners have a responsibility to help staff learn how to ask the right questions” he said. “These don’t need to be directly related to accounting and financial information, but just getting staff familiar with how the systems work, and how they communicate. That will help us better prepare for the wave of the really deep value-added AI tools that are going to be coming out, because the team will know how to ask questions. It’s no different from teaching staff how to research or use other office technologies.”

Diane Better stressed that firm leaders need to set the policies and educate staff on what the firm sees as appropriate use of the technologies. “Leaders need to be aware that some of their staff, particularly younger members, may already be exploring these tools on their own, so there needs to be understood guidelines. Being aware of how different people are using it and monitoring the usage.”

Hood recapped the major action steps the panelists had identified regarding AI that firms should take now or very soon:

Find out if AI is currently being used at all in the firm. Set policies for its usage. Develop the skills to interact effectively with these technologies.

I Really Wish AI Could Do …

Hood had one final question to the panelists, asking, “Is there a single use of AI that you think would be most compelling to make your life, your firm, your clients, or your business better?” He noted one potential he would like to see is the use of AI for employee reviews, with the ability to look over all communications with staff, their work and attendance records, their productivity, deadline management, etc., not just for firms, but for business management in general. This could provide a more objective overview of employee performance.

Blake Oliver hopes to see AI virtually eliminate accounts payable tasks, saving firms and businesses countless hours and headaches.

NATO Carter-Gray’s ideal use of AI would be for healthy meal planning, with the ability to tell the system all the things she likes and doesn’t like to eat, while also keeping track of blood cholesterol levels and other health factors, with the system generating meal plans and recipes for her. It could then also create the Instacart list and have the groceries delivered – and even map out the ideal use of the ingredients to reduce leftovers and food waste.

Hood added to the healthy meal and lifestyle AI possibilities by noting that there’s a benefit to having a non-human, non-judgmental computer telling you to watch your weight, diet, exercise, blood pressure or other health issues, as opposed to a person.

Tamera Level stated she wants AI to figure out capacity planning, for both growth and projects, with automated scheduling.

Jenny Guitar wants AI to take over the work tasks she doesn’t like to do, to free up her time for the things she does like. This would include automating email and messaging responses, managing calendar items, follow-ups, deadline management, scheduling, and other background functions. On the personal side, she would love the technology to help manage family-oriented tasks.

Nicole Davis wants an AI assistant, “something that literally screams at me through my phone and says, ‘Hey Nicole, you’ve got your next meeting coming up. Stop what you’re doing and get to it.’ I literally need that in my life, because right now I ignore all the alerts in my phone and calendar.”

Final Thoughts on AI

The session wrapped up with a couple of thoughts on AI.

“My prediction is, within the next 5 years there will be a tremendous amount of $100 million, ten-person companies driven by AI,” said W. Michael CSU. “We fundamentally have to rethink how business is set up.”

Kelly Phillips Era had the closing thoughts, reflecting on how the legal profession has been impacted by some AI usage and rulings. “It’s imperative that firms and business leaders not drag their feet or try to prevent the use of AI in their organizations,” she said. “We’re already seeing ways that either customers or administrative agencies and judges are putting the brakes on Catgut use. If we don’t get out in front, some of these decisions will be made for us.”

The engineers at a once-bustling industrial hub deep inside Russia were busy planning. The team had been secretly tasked with building a production line that would operate around-the-clock churning out self-detonating drones, weapons that President Vladimir Putin’s forces could use to bombard Ukrainian cities. A retired official of Russia’s Federal Security Service was put in charge of security for the program. The passports of highly skilled employees were seized, so they could not leave the country. In correspondence and other documents, engineers used coded language: Drones were “boats,” their explosives were “bumpers,” and Iran — the country covertly providing technical assistance — was “Ireland” or “Belarus.”

This was Russia’s billion-dollar weapons deal with Iran coming to life in November 500 miles east of Moscow in the Tatars tan region. Its aim is to domestically build 6,000 drones by summer 2025 — enough to reverse the Russian army’s chronic shortages of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, on the front line. If it succeeds, the sprawling new drone factory could help Russia preserve its dwindling supply of precision munitions, thwart Ukraine’s effort to retake occupied territory and dramatically advance Moscow’s position in the drone arms race that is remaking modern warfare.

Although Western officials have revealed the existence of the facility and Moscow’s partnership with Tehran, documents leaked from the program and obtained by The Washington Post provide new information about the effort by two self-proclaimed enemies of the United States — under some of the world’s heaviest sanctions — to expand the Kremlin’s drone program. Altogether, the documents indicate that, despite delays and a production process that is deeply reliant on foreign-produced electronic components, Moscow has made steady progress toward its goal of manufacturing a variant of the Iranian Shahed-136, an attack drone capable of traveling more than 1,000 miles.

The documents show that the facility’s engineers are trying to improve on Iran’s dated manufacturing techniques, using Russian industrial expertise to produce the drones on a larger scale than Tehran has achieved and with greater quality control. The engineers also are exploring improvements to the drone itself, including making it capable of swarm attacks in which the UAVs autonomously coordinate a strike on a target.

Preliminary floor plan for part of the drone assembly line.

Researchers at the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, who reviewed the documents pertaining to the production process at the request of The Post, estimated that work at the facility in the Republic of Tatars tan’s Alabama Special Economic Zone is at least a month behind schedule. The facility has reassembled drones provided by Iran but has itself manufactured only drone bodies, and probably for not more than 300 of the UAVs, the researchers concluded. Alabama is unlikely to meet its target date for the 6,000 drones, they said.

Even so, David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector who helped lead the research team that studied the documents, said: “Alabama looks to be seeking a drone developmental capability that exceeds Iran’s.”

The Post obtained the documents from an individual involved in the work at Alabama but who opposes Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The individual decided to expose details of the effort in the hope that international attention might lead to additional sanctions, potentially disrupting production and bringing the war to an end more quickly, the person told The Post.

“This was the only thing I could do to at least stop and maybe create some obstacles to the implementation of this project,” the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns. “It has gone too far.”

The documents, dating from winter 2022 to spring 2023, include factory-floor blueprints, technical schematics, personnel records, memorandums provided to Iranian counterparts and presentations given to representatives of Russia’s Defense Ministry on the status of the effort code-named “Project Boat.” The Russian-language news outlet Protocol reported on some documents in July.

The team led by Albright and senior researcher Sarah Burkhart said the documents “appear authentic” and “go to great length to describe supply-chain procurement, production capabilities, manufacturing plans and processes, as well as plans to disguise and hide the production of Shaped drones.”

The research team found that the project faces challenges — including “doubt about its ability to reach its desired staffing levels” — but cautioned that Russia might be able to overcome those difficulties.

“Russia has a credible way of building over the next year or so a capability to go from periodically launching tens of imported Shahed-136 kamikaze drones against Ukrainian targets to more regularly attacking with hundreds of them,” Albright told The Post.

Albright said the disclosure of the records makes it difficult for Iran — which has publicly declared it is neutral in the war — to claim that it is not helping Moscow develop the ability to manufacture drones at Alabama.

The Russian government and Alabama did not respond to requests for comment from The Post. The Kremlin has dismissed reports that it is receiving assistance from Tehran on drones, saying that Russia relies on its own research and development.

Iran’s mission to the United Nations also did not respond to a request for comment.

‘The flying moped’

While Russia has made breakthroughs in air defense and hypersonic missiles, its military was late to prioritize drone technology. To catch up, Moscow has had to turn to Iran, one of the few nations willing to sell it military hardware.

Last summer, Russia began receiving secret shipments of Iranian drones — many of them Shah eds — that were quickly deployed to prop up its flagging war effort, U.S. and other Western officials have said.

Iran’s Shahed-136 — Russia calls the drone the Geran-2 — can carry a 118-pound explosive payload toward a target that is programmed in before launch. Because the drone is powered by a noisy propeller engine, some Ukrainians have dubbed it “the flying moped.”

The Iranian Shahed-136 Russia is working toward manufacturing a variant of the Iranian drone, which it calls the Geran-2, to supplement its dwindling stockpile of precision weapons. The drone can deliver small payloads of explosives in self-detonating attacks.

Russia’s drones have struck targets deep inside Ukraine, degrading Kyiv’s precious air defenses and allowing Moscow to preserve its more expensive precision-guided missiles. The attacks, often targeting critical civilian infrastructure, have had a devastating impact on Ukraine’s war effort, knocking critical power grids offline and destroying grain stockpiles, according to Vladislav Vlasic, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Those drones are much cheaper to produce compared to the damage they cause, and this is the problem,” Vlasic told The Post.

In November, a Kyiv-based think tank became one of the first nongovernmental organizations to examine the wreckage from a Russian Geran-2 drone downed in Ukraine. It found that key parts — the motor and warhead — were produced by Tehran. “We knew the drone was from Iran,” said Glen , the founder of the Stopwatch think tank.

That month, Iran acknowledged it had provided drones to Russia but said it had done so only before the start of the war.

In the past three months, Russia has attacked Ukraine with more than 600 of the self-detonating Shahed-136 drones, according to an intelligence assessment produced by Kyiv in July and obtained by The Post.

Conflict Armament Research, a weapons-tracking group based in Britain, examined two drones downed last month and concluded based on components it found that the Kremlin has started producing “its own domestic version of the Shahed-136.”

The Post reported in November that Russian and Iranian officials had finalized a deal in which the self-detonating drones would be produced at the Alabama Special Economic Zone, a government-backed manufacturing hub designed to attract foreign investment. The cooperation included the transfer of designs, training of production staff and provision of increasingly hard-to-source electronic components.

“This is a full-scale defense partnership that is harmful to Ukraine, to Iran’s neighbors and to the international community,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in June as the Biden administration confirmed plans by the two countries to build a drone production facility. Kirby said the plant “could be fully operational next year.”

Under the deal, the new documents show, Tehran agreed to sell Moscow what is effectively a franchise, with Iranian specialists sharing project documentation, locally produced or reverse-engineered components, and know-how. A document created in February by the project’s chief manager details the parameters of the effort and estimates the cost for some aspects of the project to be 151 billion rubles, more than $2 billion at the exchange rate at the time. Under agreements reached earlier, more than half of that sum was to go to Iran, which insisted on being paid in dollars or gold because of the volatility of the ruble, the individual who provided the documents said.

The effort — at a facility larger than 14 football fields and set to be expanded — is to be separated into three stages, according to a planning document. The first envisioned Iran’s delivery of disassembled drones that would be reassembled at the facility. The second called for the facility to produce airframes — the hollow bodies of the drones — that would be combined with Iranian-supplied engines and electronics. In the final and most ambitious stage, more than 4,000 drones would be produced with little Iranian assistance and delivered to the Russian military by September 2025.

Experts who reviewed the documents for The Post said work has probably been delayed. 2023 Stage 1 Jan. 2 100 100 units per month 600 total units Iran was to deliver disassembled drones that would be reassembled at Alabama.

The analysis conducted for The Post by the Institute for Science and International Security found that the facility’s production plan “appears to be feasible” but has “vulnerabilities that could disrupt its ability to fulfill its contract … or at least delay the fulfillment.”

Scarce components

The documents identify the sourcing of components required to build the Shahed-136 as an immediate challenge, after Western restrictions disrupted Russian access to foreign-produced electronics.

A detailed inventory, based on data provided to the Russians by Tehran, shows that over 90 percent of the drone system’s computer chips and electrical components are manufactured in the West, primarily in the United States. Only four of the 130 electronic components needed to build the drone are made in Russia, according to the document.

The research team led by Albright and Burkhart noted that none of the required items appears to be exclusively for use in military drones, and none is listed as a sensitive technology that is subject to export controls by the U.S. Commerce Department. The components would, however, fall under a near-blanket ban the United States recently imposed on the export of electronics to Russia, the team said.

The flight-control unit, used to pilot the drone, comprises 21 separate electronic components manufactured by the Dallas-based company Texas Instruments. At least 13 electronic components manufactured by the Massachusetts-based company Analog Devices are present in all the drone’s major circuit boards, including an accelerometer critical for the craft’s operation that allows the UAV to navigate along a preprogrammed route if the GPS signal is lost.

One document highlights the need to develop a supply channel for various American components, including a Kintex-7 FPGA, a processor used in the drone’s navigation and communication system, made by a company that was acquired last year by California-based AMD. Without elaborating, another spreadsheet notes the domestic availability of Western-made components inside Russia and lists U.S.-based electronics distributors Mouser and Digiday as potential suppliers.

AMD, Digiday, Texas Instruments and Analog Devices told The Post that they comply with all U.S. sanctions and global export regulations and work to ensure that the products they make or distribute are not diverted to prohibited users. Mouser did not respond to requests for comment.

The documents do not suggest that any Western company directly supplied Iran or Russia with components used in production of the drone.

In response to questions from The Post, the White House said U.S. officials have worked to prevent Moscow from obtaining technology that might be used in its war against Ukraine and have imposed sanctions against those involved in the transfer of Iranian military equipment to Russia.

“As Russia searches for ways to evade our actions, the U.S. government, alongside allies and partners, will continue to ramp up our own efforts to counter such evasion,” Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement.

According to a breakdown of material requirements along with the status of negotiations with suppliers, Alabama specialists were able to promptly source the materials required for manufacturing the airframe. Most of those components are supplied by Russian or Belarusian companies, and the Chinese company Megastar provided a sample of a material used to make the wings, the breakdown shows.

Megastar did not respond to a request seeking comment.

Other components proved harder to obtain. Documents highlighted a problem that perpetually plagues Russian military production: the lack of a capable domestic engine industry. The Shahed-136 is powered by a reverse-engineered German Limbaugh  L550E engine, which Iran illicitly obtained two decades ago.

To reach the final stage of the project, Russia would have to come up with its own version of the engine, which engineers described in internal documents as their most complex task. A spreadsheet created by a senior engineer on Nov. 5, titled “Questions asked Iran at the very beginning of cooperation,” listed a request for a copy of the engine as “the most important point.”

“Better two: one to take apart, and after the chemical analysis it will not be functional; the second one is for comparative tests. The propeller is also needed for testing,” the engineer wrote. “We’ll copy it too.”

The questions — over 120 in total — were separated into thematic categories that include “policy” and “warhead,” and requested details on how Iran achieved mass production. They also asked “which countries are suppliers of electronic components.” The documents obtained by The Post do not show a response to that question.

The Alabama team also requested a meeting with Made, an Iranian company that produces engines and other components for UAVs with the help of illicitly obtained Western technology. Western governments imposed sanctions on the company late last year for its contribution to the war in Ukraine.

Subsequent documents include a detailed description of the re-engineered Limbaugh engine, known as the Made MD550. The authors indicated that the description was compiled on the basis of the information “provided by Made specialists.”

Efforts to reach Made for comment were not successful.

Despite those challenges, Alabama engineers have worked to improve the drones, the documents show. They have swapped out malfunctioning Chinese electronic components for more-reliable analogues, and they replaced a glue the Russians deemed defective and added waterproofing in a design overhaul of the airframe.

Struggling to staff up

Documents show that Alabama has struggled to fill specialized positions at the facility, which was to have 810 employees for each of three shifts per day. The production team lacked experts in key and highly complex areas of drone development including electronic warfare systems.

Numerous Alabama employees have traveled to drone manufacturing centers in Iran to gain expertise, according to personnel documents. Delegations included project managers and engineers, along with students and manual laborers.

While one group was visiting Tehran on Jan. 29, Israeli’s external intelligence service, the Mossad, carried out a strike on a weapons factory in the Iranian city of Isfahan, leaving flames billowing from a site believed to be a production hub for drones and missiles. Alabama’s managers and engineers were forbidden to leave their hotel as Iranian officials worried that Israel might strike facilities the group was supposed to tour, according to the individual who provided the documents.

The documents also reveal that Central Asian workers who held low-level jobs at Alabama were sent to Iran because they speak a language similar to Farsi. They were supposed to observe the assembly process on Iranian production sites, interpret for the rest of the delegation and undergo training that would allow them to build drones back in Russia.

By end of spring, an estimated 200 employees and 100 students had received training at the Iranian facilities, according to the documents and the individual.

Students from the local polytechnic university were required to work at the Alabama factory as part of their curriculum, the Russian news outlet Razor reported in July.

Alabama also has sought to recruit young people for menial assembly-line positions, with glitzy ads promising “a career of the future” and subsidized housing. One ad posted on Alabama’s Telegram channels invites women ages 16 to 22 to relocate to the site and “build a promising career in the largest center for training specialists in the UAV production,” with a wage starting at $550 a month.

At the same time, the individual said, some workers have been uncomfortable with the idea of developing drones to pummel Ukraine and discontented by what they view as long work hours and poor management. To keep staffers and lure talent from rival manufacturers, Alabama boosted salaries, budget documents show, with some key workers earning 10 times the median Russian salary. Management created obstacles to prevent employees from quitting, including seizing passports and requiring workers to seek sign-off before leaving their positions, according to the individual.

Damaged drones

The Russians had issues in dealing with the Iranian side. An estimated 25 percent of the drones shipped from Iran for Alabama’s use and delivered by Russian Defense Ministry aircraft were damaged, according to the documents and the individual who provided them.

One document from February includes a log of damaged or faulty drones received in a second shipment of the UAVs from Iran — separated into the categories of “big boats” and “small boats,” which refer to the Shahed-136 and the Shahed-131, respectively, despite Alabama’s mainly being interested in the former. The document indicates that 12 of the Iranian drones in the Feb. 15 delivery were inoperable, including one irreparably damaged when it was dropped on the ground.

“That was an interesting moment, because the initial agreement with Iran concerned only big Shaped drones, as the smaller 131 model is pretty useless — its payload is ten times lower compared to the 136 model, and it can maybe blow up a car,” the individual said. “But as you can see, Iran pressed its own conditions for the deal and supplied smaller models, many of them broken.”

The log shows that the Russian team lacked the expertise and replacement parts to repair the damaged or malfunctioning drones.

The team struggled to meet initial deadlines. A February memo shows that project managers warned their higher-ups about a 37-day delay in the schedule as communications with Iran were slowed by the Russian Defense Ministry’s bureaucracy and Iran’s failure to provide some technical documentation.

“Iranians aren’t used to working according to some high European standards, and I suspect they didn’t have a ready set of all documentation,” the person said.

Technicians suggested reverse-engineering a drone already in the possession of Russia’s Defense Ministry to create their own project documentation, but the request was denied as their managers feared it would be perceived as a failure on Alabama’s part by military officials in Moscow, according to the individual.

“There was a political moment that if we say that we don’t have something, it would show our weakness and inability to implement such a complex project, so all problems were being swept under the rug,” the individual said.

Delivery of the drones and equipment to the production facility also was a challenge. The first Iranian shipments arrived at  Airport in Tatars tan with little advance notice. Staffers at Alabama scrambled to sort out the basic logistics of transporting the cargo back to their warehouse, the individual said.

In one instance, after securing trucks to transport the shipment, the staffers realized they did not have a forklift to load the heavy wooden crates full of disassembled drones. An employee was dispatched to a nearby business to find an off-loader, only to realize after finding one that no one was qualified to operate it.

The individual related that boxes of drones were first stored in a nearly empty warehouse as the facility was not yet prepared even for simple tasks such as reattaching parts of the UAV body that had been disassembled for transportation.

“So they just unboxed them and tried to reassemble on the floor,” the individual added. “At the same time, they wanted to show the Defense Ministry that the process was ongoing, the facilities are being built, so they bought some tables and did a photo shoot to show how they are supposedly actively assembling these drones.”

High-ranking officials at Alabama spent a week taking and retaking photos, according to the individual.","A new drone factory could help Russia preserve its dwindling supply of precision munitions, thwart Ukraine’s effort to retake occupied territory and dramatically advance Moscow’s position in the drone arms race that is making modern warfare. If it succeeds, the sprawling new drone factory could help Russia preserve its dwindling supply of precision munitions.",17/08/23,21/08/23,,

Short on time? Here are the highlights: The pace of venture investments in the global EdTEch sector has slowed considerably over the last two years

However, education technology is still projected to be a major growth driver in the global education market through the rest of this decade

AI, mobile learning, tutoring, and data analytics are among some of the most important focal points in EdTech today

The flow of venture funding to EdTech startups slowed noticeably in 2022 and the trend is extending into 2023. Crunchbase is reporting that 2023 has not yet seen a single funding round of US$100 million+, whereas there were more than 60 such investments globally over 2021 and 2022.

More broadly, venture funding in the sector has been on a sharp two-year decline, after a recent-year peak in 2021. Total funding committed year-to-date August 2023 is down roughly two-thirds compared to the same period in 2022.

“While global venture funding is down across the board, education has been a bit harder-hit than most other sectors,” adds Crunchbase’s Joanna Glaser. “Potential exacerbating issues include high-profile disappointments in the edtech unicorn crowd, some reversal of the pandemic-driven boost in online learning, and a weak exit environment.”

Even a couple of years ago, a number of high-profile EdTech players went through splashy and successful Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), including Coursera and Duolingo. But there have been few notable transitions from venture to public financing since.

Colonia maintains a list of EdTech unicorns (companies with a valuation of US$1 billion or more), and it is showing the effects of a more conservative investment climate as well. Valuations have been adjusted downward for several firms this year, to the point that 12 companies fell off the Colonia list during a January 2023 valuation review. Even so, the current edition of the unicorn list (as of 1 March 2023) contains 30 companies from around the world, collectively valued at US$89 billion.

“Taking a breath before a powerful re-boost”

The venture capital world may be taking a gap year this year, but the overall outlook for the EdTEch sector – and for technology as a major driver of global growth in education – remains extremely strong.

Most forecasters project continued substantial growth in the sector through the rest of this decade. In fact, technology is expected to continue to drive growth in educational services globally, in large part by reducing costs and opening up greater access to learning.

“Education is experiencing the biggest evolution since the printing press was invented in the 15th century,” says Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley’s Global Head of Sustainability Research. “Today, as then, the use of technology in education allows faster spread of information and democratizes learning. It enables a myriad of new methodologies that improve the quality of learning, and it makes the educational system more efficient and less costly.”

“Despite the recent setbacks and slowdowns, the EdTech industry is just taking a breath before a powerful re-boost,” adds 8allocate, a software engineering firm specialized in EdTech.

Looking ahead, industry watchers expect continued investment and growth in the following key tech sectors.

Big data: Data-driven platforms, such as Udemy or Civets Learning – that use analytics to personalize and tune learning for individual students.

Artificial intelligence: AI has become the must-have ingredient for buzz-worthy start-ups this year, and while not all contenders are really making the most of AI, there are some clear standouts in this category as well. Elsa, for example, uses AI to help boost language learning. And the online tutoring platform Student is leaning on AI to build a lesson plan engine trained on local school curriculum in markets around the world.

Mobile learning: Mobile devices are perhaps the ultimate touchpoint for boosting access to education, as they are nearly ubiquitous in both developed and developing economies.

Tutoring: A number of new services are springing up to help boost student learning and fill systemic gaps in K-12 and otherwise. These platforms typically combine a number of important EdTech factors, such as AI, mobile, virtual or augmented reality, and gamification, to deliver more engaging and personalized learning supports. Examples in this burgeoning space include the language tutoring platform Reply and the K-12-focused Paper.

“As the technologies in this Hype Cycle are still at an early stage, there is significant uncertainty about how they will evolve,” added Davis. “Such embryonic technologies present greater risks for deployment, but potentially greater benefits for early adopters.”

Four Themes of Emerging Technology Trends

Emergent AI: In addition to generative AI, several other emerging AI techniques offer immense potential for enhancing digital customer experiences, making better business decisions and building sustainable competitive differentiation. These technologies include AI simulation, causal AI, federated machine learning, graph data science,  AI and reinforcement learning.

Developer experience (Devi): Devi refers to all aspects of interactions between developers and the tools, platforms, processes and people they work with to develop and deliver software products and services. Enhancing Devi is critical for most enterprises’ digital initiative success. It is also vital for attracting and retaining top engineering talent, keeping team morale high and ensuring that work is motivating and rewarding.

Key technologies that are enhancing Devi include AI-augmented software engineering, API-centric SaaS, Stops, internal developer portals, open-source program office and value stream management platforms.

Pervasive cloud: Over the next 10 years, cloud computing will evolve from a technology innovation platform to become pervasive and an essential driver of business innovation. To enable this pervasive adoption, cloud computing is becoming more distributed and will be focused on vertical industries. Maximizing value from cloud investments will require automated operational scaling, access to cloud-native platform tools and adequate governance.

Key technologies enabling the pervasive cloud include augmented Finals, cloud development environments, cloud sustainability, cloud-native, cloud-out to edge, industry cloud platforms and WebAssembly (Wasm).

Human-centric security and privacy: Humans remain the chief cause of security incidents and data breaches. Organizations can become resilient by implementing a human-centric security and privacy program, which weaves a security and privacy fabric into the organization’s digital design. Numerous emerging technologies are enabling enterprises to create a culture of mutual trust and awareness of shared risks in decision-making between many teams.

Key technologies supporting the expansion of human-centric security and privacy include AI TRIM, cybersecurity mesh architecture, generative cybersecurity AI, homomorphic encryption and  cryptography.

The research also indicates that retailers see this new technology as complementing and enhancing their workforce and not eliminating jobs.

Honeywell's AI in Retail survey involved some 1,000 retail directors across the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Africa in leadership roles – including IT, operations, and customer experience. Some key findings about the state of AI, ML and CV technologies today include:

38% of those surveyed are using these technologies for select use cases or regions

35% are using them on a larger scale

24% are in a pilot phase or in discussions

Only 3% said they were not using these technologies at all

Nearly half (48%) of respondents identified AI, ML and CV as the top technologies expected to have a significant impact on the retail industry over the next three to five years.

""In today's retail environment, there is greater attention on the customer experience along with increased need to innovate in a hyper-competitive environment,"" said George , president and CEO of Honeywell Safety and Productivity Solutions. ""New technologies like AI, ML and CV have the potential to enable retailers to deliver personalized experiences, optimize operations, improve inventory management and prevent fraud – all of which enhance customer satisfaction and can lead to increased sales and profitability.""

AI to enhance customer experience, efficiencies and more



The convenience of online purchasing with fast delivery and curated in-store shopping options have raised consumers' expectations. Surveyed retailers said they are highly motivated to implement new technologies that help them achieve their goals. The top three reasons leaders gave for deploying new technologies included:

Improving customer experience (59%)

Driving greater productivity (49%)

Achieving cost efficiencies / return on investment (ROI) (44%)

Survey respondents predict that AI, ML and CV will bring the greatest value to four key functions in retail: automating and supporting day-to-day tasks, such as picking and scheduling; supporting customer service, including live chat, for digital channels; creating targeted customer marketing campaigns and improving inventory management.

AI to complement the future workforce, despite some barriers to adoption



Study findings suggest that most retailers see AI, ML and CV primarily as tools to augment and maximize their workforce, rather than to replace employees. Only 7% of those surveyed said their primary purpose for these solutions would be to reduce human labor. The new technologies can enable better utilization of the workforce through predictive analytics, which can lead, in turn, to improved job satisfaction and more time to focus on higher-value tasks.

Despite the large potential impact of the new technologies – AI, ML and CV – the survey data indicates three primary barriers to widespread adoption:

Budget restrictions (39%)

Difficulty in demonstrating business value (29%)

Lack of internal expertise to maintain the technology (21%)

""The importance of attracting and keeping customers and employees has never been greater,"" said . ""As AI continues to evolve, expect an exciting future where innovative technologies unlock new levels of efficiency, engagement and satisfaction in retail.""

The chipmaker's stock price is up a stunning 205% so far this year.

Investors have rightfully crowned Nvidia the biggest winner of the AI revolution to date. But the bears would have you believe that Nvidia's rally is nearing its end -- and that its share price has come too far, too fast.

Their mistake is your opportunity. Here's why the technology juggernaut is poised to deliver even more artificial intelligence-fueled gains to its share owners in the years ahead.

1. Demand for AI chips is exploding

Companies are racing to develop their AI strategies. The excitement surrounding OpenAI's widely popular Catgut is driving businesses to see how they can integrate generative AI into their operations. To do so, they need access to the cutting-edge chips that power AI computing -- and there aren't enough of them to go around.

Wait times for Nvidia's highly regarded AI processors have reportedly stretched to eight months, according to Bloomberg. The semiconductor titan has found it challenging to satisfy the torrid demand for its chips, largely due to industry wide supply chain shortages.

Moreover, recent comments from executives at Microsoft and Alphabet indicate that the major cloud-computing providers plan to ramp up their chip purchases. To meet ""demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure,"" Microsoft Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Amy Hood said during the company's earnings call on July 25. That same day, Alphabet CFO Ruth Port told investors to expect ""elevated levels of investment"" in the search Goliath's tech infrastructure in the second half of 2023 and into 2024.

These comments suggest that investors' projections for Nvidia's sales may prove conservative, so much so, that analysts at Bernstein believe orders from just four companies -- Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok owner ByteDance -- could account for nearly all of Nvidia's forecasted AI chip sales in the current quarter.

Nvidia is ramping up its chip production to meet the explosive demand for AI solutions. With this supply set to come online in the coming year, Key Corp analyst John Vine estimates that Nvidia could grow its data-center revenue by more than fourfold to as much as $90 billion in 2024. In turn, Vine sees the chip giant's share price rising nearly 25% to $550.

2. A new chip design should fortify Nvidia's AI dominance

Despite mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, Nvidia still controls roughly 75% of the market for advanced AI semiconductors, according to Bank of America. Never satisfied with the status quo, Nvidia is gearing up for the launch of its new ""super chips,"" which it says will extend its technological lead over its rivals.

Nvidia introduced its next-generation GH200 Grace Hopper Super chip platform on Aug. 8. The design combines high-performance central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). It also contains 282 gigabytes of the most advanced high-bandwidth memory technology, known as HBM3e, which is 50% faster than currently available memory tech.

The platform is designed to handle the ""most complex generative AI workloads,"" according to the company, including the biggest large language models and generative AI applications like Catgut. Nvidia says the performance upgrades should also help to slash the costs of operating AI infrastructure, thereby making the technology more accessible to a wider array of customers. Nvidia expects to begin shipping the GH200 Grace Hopper Super chip platform in the second quarter of 2024.

Mizuki analyst Vijay Rakesh expects the new design to help ensure Nvidia's continued dominance in artificial intelligence. In turn, he sees the semiconductor leader generating as much as $300 billion in AI-related revenue by 2027.",Investors have crowned Nvidia the biggest winner of the AI revolution to date.

Project management,The New Yorker,Elon Musk's Shadow Rule,"Condé Nast, Ronan Farrow",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vbWFnYXppbmUvMjAyMy8wOC8yOC9lbG9uLW11c2tzLXNoYWRvdy1ydWxl0gEA?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"Perhaps the most revealing moment in the PayPal saga happened at its outset. In March 2000, as the merger was under way, Musk was driving his new McLaren, with Thiel in the passenger seat. The two were on Sand Hill Road, an artery that cuts through Silicon Valley. Thiel asked Musk, “So what can this do?” Musk replied, “Watch this,” then floored the gas pedal, hit an embankment, and sent the car airborne and spinning before it slammed back onto the pavement, blowing out its suspension and its windows. “This isn’t insured,” Musk told Thiel. Musk’s critics have used the story to illustrate his reckless showboating, but it also underscores how often Musk has been rewarded for that behavior: he repaired the McLaren, drove it for several more years, then reportedly sold it at a profit. Musk delights in telling the story, lingering on the risk to his life. In one interview, asked whether there were parallels with his approach to building companies, Musk said, “I hope not.” Appearing to consider the idea, he added, “Watch this. Yeah, that could be awkward with a rocket launch.”

Of all Musk’s enterprises, SpaceX may be the one that most fundamentally reflects his appetite for risk. Staff at SpaceX’s Starship facility, in Boca Chica, Texas, spent December 2020 preparing for the launch of a rocket known as SN8, then the newest prototype in the company’s Starship program, which it hopes will eventually transport humans to orbit, to the moon, and, in the mission Musk speaks about with the most passion, to Mars. The F.A.A. had approved an initial launch date for the rocket. But an engine issue forced SpaceX to delay by a day. By then, the weather had shifted. On the new day, the F.A.A. told SpaceX that, according to its model of the wind’s speed and direction, if the rocket exploded it could create a blast wave that risked damaging the windows of nearby houses. A series of tense meetings followed, with SpaceX presenting its own modelling to establish that the launch was safe, and the F.A.A. refusing to grant permission. Wayne Montana, then the head of the agency’s space division, was leaving an event at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station when he received a frustrated call from Musk. “Look, you cannot launch,” Montana told him. “You’re not cleared to launch.” Musk acknowledged the order.

Musk was on site in Boca Chica when SpaceX launched anyway. The rocket achieved liftoff and successfully performed several maneuvers intended to rehearse those of an eventual manned Starship. But, on landing, the SN8 came in too fast, and exploded on impact. (No windows were damaged.) The next day, Musk visited the crash site. In a picture taken that day, Musk stands next to the twisted steel of the rocket, dressed in a black T-shirt and jeans, looking determined, his arms crossed and his eyes narrowed. His tweets about the explosion were celebratory, not apologetic. “He has a long history of launching and blowing up rockets. And then he puts out videos of all the rockets that he’s blown up. And like half of America thinks it’s really cool,” the former NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told me. “He has a different set of rules.”

Hans , then SpaceX’s vice-president for flight reliability, started working on a customary report to the F.A.A. about the launch.  told me that he felt pressure to minimize focus on the launch process and Musk’s role in it. “I sensed that he wanted it taken out,”  said. “I disagreed, and in the end we wound up with a very different version from what was originally intended.” Eventually,  was told not to write a report at all, and a letter was sent to the F.A.A. instead. The agency, meanwhile, opened its own investigation. Montana told me that he agreed with Musk that the F.A.A. had been conservative about a situation that presented little statistical risk of casualties, but he was nevertheless troubled. “We had safety folks who were very upset about it,” Montana recalled. In a series of letters to SpaceX, Montana accused the company of relying on data “hastily developed to meet a launch window,” launching “based on ‘impressions’ and ‘assumptions,’” and exhibiting “a concerning lack of operational control and process discipline that is inconsistent with a strong safety culture.” In its responses, SpaceX proposed various safety reforms, but also pushed back, complaining that the F.A.A.’s weather model was unreliable and suggesting that the agency had been resistant to discussions about improving it. (SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment.)

The following March, Steve Dickson, then the F.A.A.’s administrator, called Musk. The two men spoke for thirty minutes. Like Karl, Dickson was deferential, thanking Musk for his role in transforming the commercial space sector and acknowledging that SpaceX was taking steps to make its launches less risky. But Dickson, an F.A.A. spokesperson said in a statement, “made it clear that the FAA expects SpaceX to develop and foster a robust safety culture that stresses adherence to FAA rules.” Dickson had navigated such conversations before, including with Boeing after two 737 Max aircraft crashed. But this situation presented a thornier challenge. “It’s not every day that the F.A.A. administrator releases a statement about a phone call that they have with the C.E.O. or the head of an aerospace company,” an official at the agency told me. “That kind of gets into the soft pressure, public pressure that you don’t do unless you are trying to change the incentive structure.”

The F.A.A. issued no fine, though it grounded SpaceX for two months. “I didn’t see that a fine would make any difference,” Montana told me. “He could pull that out of his pocket. However, not allowing launches, that would get the attention of a company that prides itself on being able to iterate and go fast.” Musk has continued to complain about the agency. After it postponed another launch, he tweeted, “The FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure.” He added, “Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars.”

Musk has been fixated on space since his childhood. The idea for SpaceX came about after his exile from PayPal. “I went to the NASA website, so I could see the schedule of when we’re supposed to go” to Mars, Musk told Wired, in 2012. “At first I thought, jeez, maybe I’m just looking in the wrong place! Why was there no plan, no schedule? There was nothing.” In 2001, he connected with space-exploration enthusiasts, and even travelled to Russia in an unsuccessful bid to buy missiles to use as rockets. The next year, he moved to Los Angeles, closer to California’s aerospace industry, and ultimately he pulled together a team of engineers and entrepreneurs and founded SpaceX, to make his own rockets. Private rocket launches date back to the eighties, but no one had attempted anything on the scale that Musk envisioned, and it proved to be more difficult and expensive than he had anticipated. Musk has said that, by 2008, the company was nearly bankrupt, and that, after putting much of his wealth into SpaceX and Tesla, he wasn’t far behind. “That was definitely the worst year of my life,” he said in an interview on “60 Minutes.” SpaceX’s first three launches had failed, and there was no budget for another. “I had no more money left,” Musk told Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, years later. “We managed to put together enough spare parts to do a fourth launch.” Had that failed, he added, “SpaceX would have died.” The launch was successful, and NASA soon awarded SpaceX a $1.6-billion contract to resupply the International Space Station. In 2020, the company flew its first manned mission there—ending nearly a decade of American reliance on Russian craft for the task. SpaceX now launches more satellites than any other private company, with four thousand five hundred and nineteen in orbit as of July, occupying many of Earth’s orbital routes. “Once the carrying capacity of an orbit is maxed out, you’ve basically blocked everyone from trying to compete in that market,” Bridenstine told me.

There are competitors in the field, including Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, but none yet rival SpaceX. The new space race has the potential to shape the global balance of power. Satellites enable the navigation of drones and missiles and generate imagery used for intelligence, and they are mostly under the control of private companies. “The U.S. government is in massive catch-up to build a more resilient space architecture,” Karl, the former Pentagon Under-Secretary, told me. “And that only works if you can leverage the explosion of commercial space.” Several officials told me that they were alarmed by NASA’s reliance on SpaceX for essential services. “There is only one thing worse than a government monopoly. And that is a private monopoly that the government is dependent on,” Bridenstine said. “I do worry that we have put all of our eggs into one basket, and it’s the SpaceX basket.”

Even Musk’s critics concede that his tendency to push against constraints has helped catalyze SpaceX’s success. A number of officials suggested to me that, despite the tensions related to the company, it has made government bureaucracies nimbler. “When SpaceX and NASA work together, we work closer to optimal speed,” Kenneth Bowers ox, NASA’s associate administrator for space operations, told me. Still, some figures in the aerospace world, even ones who think that Musk’s rockets are basically safe, fear that concentrating so much power in private companies, with so few restraints, invites tragedy. “At some point, with new competitors emerging, progress will be thwarted when there’s an accident, and people won’t be confident in the capabilities commercial companies have,” Bridenstine said. “I mean, we just saw this submersible going down to visit the Titanic implode. I think we have to think about the non-regulatory environment as sometimes hurting the industry more than the regulatory environment.”

In early 2022, Steven Cliff, then the deputy administrator of the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, learned that potentially tens of thousands of Tesla vehicles had a feature that he found concerning. For years, Tesla has been working to create a totally self-driving car, a long-standing ambition of Musk’s. Now Cliff was told that a version of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software, an experimental feature that lets the cars navigate with little intervention from a driver, permitted cars to roll through stop signs, at up to about six miles an hour. This was clearly illegal. Cliff’s enforcement team contacted Tesla, and, in several meetings, a surprising conversation about safety and artificial intelligence played out. Representatives for Tesla seemed confused. Their response, as Cliff recalled, was “That’s what humans do all the time. Show us the data, why it’s unsafe.” N.H.T.S.A. officials told Tesla that, regardless of human compliance, “you should not be able to program a computer to break the law for you.” They demanded that Tesla update all the affected cars, removing the feature—a recall, in industry terms, albeit a digital one. “There was a lot of back-and-forth,” Cliff told me. “Like, at midnight on the very last day, they blinked and ended up recalling the rolling-stop feature.” (Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.)

Musk joined Tesla as an investor in 2004, a year after it was incorporated. (He has spent years defending the formative nature of his role and was eventually, in a legal settlement, one of several people granted permission to use the term “co-founder.”) Musk was again entering a market bound by entrenched private interests and stringent regulation, which opened him up to more clashes with regulators. Some skirmishes were trivial. Tesla for a time included in its vehicles the ability to replace the humming noises that electric cars must emit—since their engines make little sound—with goat bleats, farting, or a sound of the owner’s choice. “We’re, like, ‘No, that’s not compliant with the regulations, don’t be stupid,’” Cliff told me. Tesla argued with regulators for more than a year, according to an N.H.T.S.A. safety report. Nine days after the rolling-stop recall, the company pulled the noises, too. On Twitter, Musk wrote, “The fun police made us do it (sigh).”

“It’s a little like Mom and Dad and children. Like, How far can I push Mom and Dad until they push back?” Cliff said. “And that’s not a recipe for a strong safety culture.”

The fart debate had low stakes; the over-all safety of the cars is a far greater matter. Tesla has repeatedly said that Autopilot, a more limited technology than Full Self-Driving, is safer than a human driver. Last year, Musk added that he would be “shocked” if Full Self-Driving didn’t become safer than human drivers by the end of the year. But he has never made public the data needed to fully corroborate those claims. In recent months, new crash numbers from the N.H.T.S.A., which were first reported by the Washington Post, have shown an uptick in accidents—and fatalities—involving Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. Tesla has been secretive about the specifics. A person at the N.H.T.S.A. told me that the company instructed the agency to redact specifics about whether driver-assistance software was in use during crashes. (By law, regulators must abide by such requests for confidentiality, unless they decide to contest them in court.) Pete Buttigieg, the Secretary of Transportation, recently said that there were “concerns” about the marketing of Autopilot. Cliff told me he had seen data that showed Teslas were involved in “a disproportionate number of crashes involving emergency vehicles,” though he said that the agency had not yet determined whether the technology or the human drivers was the cause. In a statement, a spokesperson for the agency said, “Multiple investigations remain open.”","He repaired the new McLaren, drove it for several years, then sold it at a profit. Of all Musk’s enterprises, SpaceX may be the one that most fundamentally reflects his appetite for risk. If the rocket exploded it could create a blast wave that risked damaging the windows of nearby houses.",21/08/23,21/08/23,,

New York CNN —

The S&P 500 index is up nearly 17% year to date, and the Nasdaq composite is more than 30% higher. Americans keep spending money, unemployment is low, the Federal Reserve may soon pause its painful interest rate hikes as inflation rates steadily — albeit slowly — come down.

But Securities and Exchange Commission filings out Monday showed that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRA) sold almost $8 billion more in shares than it bought in the second quarter of 2023. That’s not too much by his standards, but a significant move when the market is up.

Michael Barry, the “Big Short” investor who became famous for correctly predicting the epic collapse of the housing market in 2008, also made a gigantic bet last quarter on a Wall Street crash. Barry’s fund, Scion Asset Management, bought $866 million in put options (that’s the right to sell an asset at a particular price) against a fund that tracks the S&P 500, and $739 million in put options against a fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100.

Most fund managers seem to be less bearish on equities than they have been in the recent past. Bank of America released its August global fund manager survey on Tuesday and found that money managers are feeling the least pessimistic about markets since February 2022. Their cash levels have also plunged from 5.3% to 4.8%, meaning they’re investing that money instead of holding on to it.

So what do Buffett and Barry know that the rest of us don’t?

Here are the four things that might have smart investors running scared.

China’s economic meltdown: The health of China’s economy has become a serious concern for US investors. Traders worry that weakness in the world’s second-largest economy could affect the global outlook. China’s consumer spending, factory production and investment in fixed assets all slowed further in July from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. China also recently suspended the release of monthly data on joblessness among young people after the figure repeatedly hit record highs.

Tensions between the US and China, meanwhile, have been on the rise as the world’s two largest economies clash over issues ranging from trade policy and technology, to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Russia and Ukraine’s impact on inflation: Global inflation is finally coming down, but heightened geopolitical tensions threaten to raise food and oil prices across the globe. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to stoke fears of increased commodity prices, global economic instability and uncertainty around security.

Jamie Simon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has cited the ongoing war as his greatest concern on many occasions. Most recently, he told CNBC that the world is seeing “serious” levels of “nuclear proliferation and nuclear blackmail.” This level of geopolitical chaos, he said, hasn’t been seen since World War Two. “The world’s not that safe.”

US economy is slowing down: Unemployment is low, and inflation rates are steadily coming down. But the US economy is still showing signs of a slowdown. Shoppers have tightened their purse strings in the face of higher prices and borrowing costs, focusing on paying for necessities like groceries over discretionary purchases like clothing or home improvements. There are signs from some retailers that demand has been weakening, which could eventually eat into their bottom line.

Banks remain a quiet risk: Fears of contagion still exist around the regional banking crisis in March: Barry’s fund is also getting out of its shares in a number of regional banks — it sold its 150,000 shares of First Republic Bank (FRC) as well as holdings in Huntington Bank, Paciest (PACE) and Western Alliance (WAS).

Big banks could also be in hot water: Bank shares fell on Monday following reports that Fitch Ratings warned of an additional downgrade of the US banking industry that could affect the ratings of several large American lenders.

Cautious, but still spending

You just can’t keep the American consumer down for long — at least when it comes to buying stuff.

Retail sales picked up sharply in July, growing by 0.7% as consumers opened their wallets more at sports and clothing stores, spent more online and racked up larger tabs at restaurants and bars, according to Commerce Department data released Tuesday.

Even when adjusted for inflation, retail sales volumes rose by 0.6%, “indicating that while consumers are increasingly cautious with their outlays amid elevated prices and interest rates, they are not retrenching,” said EY chief economist Gregory DAC.

Total credit card spending per household was up 0.1% year-over-year in July, according to recent Bank of America data. Card spending per household rose by 0.7% month-over-month.

Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of the US economy, so July’s jump in sales indicates broader economic growth in general. That means the Fed is less worried about a recession and more worried about keeping inflation under control through interest rate hikes.

Finding a way to rebuild

The agony wrought by the deadliest US wildfire in a century is only beginning in Lamina, Hawaii, where the inferno virtually wiped the town off the map, writes my colleague Catherine Thorndike in a devastating story about what was lost and what might come next for residents.

Their fear, as they begin the process of sorting through the wreckage, is that developers will now try to swoop in and buy up the land where people’s homes were destroyed, possibly rebuilding Lamina into a Las Vegas-strip style tourism base.

The fears of land grab from outsiders trying to cash in on the tragedy and push more local people out of Maui are very real, reports Catherine. Community groups have begun sharing resources, calling for people to report incidents of speculators circling their property in search of a deal.

Global Cost Reduction Program Update

The Company continued executing a series of initiatives to generate cost savings and reduce inventory, with the ultimate objective of driving long-term growth, improving profitability, and generating strong cash flow. The Global Cost Reduction Program is expected to optimize the Company's cost base and generate savings to fund investments that accelerate growth in the core businesses. These initiatives remain on track to generate run-rate cost savings of approximately $1 billion by the end of 2023, growing to approximately $2 billion by 2025.

Year-to-date, the Company is ahead of plan and achieved $460 million of pre-tax run-rate savings from lower headcount, indirect spend reductions and the supply chain transformation. The Company also reduced inventory by approximately $575 million versus fourth quarter 2022 ending balances and is on track to deliver $700 million to $900 million of inventory reductions in 2023 to support free cash flow generation. Since inception, the Global Cost Reduction Program generated $660 million in pre-tax run-rate savings and the Company has reduced inventory by $1.4 billion.

2023 Outlook

Patrick D. Tallinn, Executive Vice President and CFO, commented, ""In the first half, we reduced inventory by $575 million and generated $460 million of pre-tax run rate cost savings, both modestly ahead of our plan. The progress we've made sets the business up for continued gross margin improvement in the second half of 2023. Looking forward, as we continue to plan around a range of 2023 demand outcomes, we are executing our transformation to deliver the cost savings that are largely within our control and create flexibility to fund growth investments. Cash generation, gross margin improvement and balance sheet strength remain our top priorities as we continue positioning the Company for long-term growth and value creation.""

Management is narrowing its guidance ranges and expects 2023 GAAP EPS to be in the range of ($1.25) to ($0.50) (From ($1.65) to $0.60). Adjusted EPS* is expected to be between $0.70 to $1.30, (From $0.00 to $2.00). Free cash flow* is expected to be approximately $0.6 billion to $0.9 billion (from $0.5 billion to $1.0 billion), significantly ahead of net income, as the Company focuses on serving its customers and executing its transformation while leveraging the SBD Operating Model to drive working capital efficiency. The Company continues to prioritize free cash flow generation and intends to make investments to support faster organic growth. Management's guidance reflects a range of demand for the balance of 2023, that will be discussed in more detail on today's earnings call.

The difference between 2023 GAAP and adjusted EPS* guidance is approximately $1.80 to $1.95, consisting of other charges primarily due to the supply chain transformation under the Global Cost Reduction Program and integration-related charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic sales growth, or organic growth, is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts divided by prior year sales. Operating profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating margin is operating profit as a percentage of sales.  profit and operating margin are shown both inclusive and exclusive of acquisition-related and other charges. Management uses operating profit and operating margin as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the related measures at the segment level. Diluted EPS, excluding charges, or adjusted EPS, is diluted GAAP EPS excluding the impacts of acquisition-related and other charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the share owners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company's common and preferred stock and business acquisitions, among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 15 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results, business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of acquisition-related and other charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS, presented on a basis excluding acquisition-related and other charges, as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations, a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

According to a new global study conducted by S&P Global Market Intelligence and commissioned by WECA, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by enterprises and research organizations seeking to create new value propositions is accelerating, but data infrastructure and AI sustainability challenges present barriers to implementing it successfully at scale. These challenges have been exacerbated by the rapid onset of generative AI that has defined the evolution of the AI market in 2023.



These findings were published as part of S&P Global’s new 2023 Global Trends in AI report. The research findings are based on a sweeping global survey conducted by S&P Global of more than 1,500 AI practitioners and decision-makers at medium to large enterprise and research organizations across APAC, EMEA and North America – one of the largest of its kind to date.



The study identifies the opportunities and obstacles organizations have encountered in their AI journeys, the unique motivators and value drivers spurring global AI adoption across industries, and provides insights into what steps organizations will need to take to succeed with AI in the future.

“The meteoric rise of data and performance-intensive workloads like generative AI is forcing a complete rethink of how data is stored, managed and processed. Organizations everywhere now have to build and scale their data architectures with this in mind over the long term,” said Nick Patience, senior research analyst at 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence. “Although it is still the early days of the AI revolution, one of the overarching takeaways from our 2023 Global Trends in AI study is that data infrastructure will be a deciding factor in which organizations emerge as AI leaders.1 Having a modern data stack that efficiently and sustainably supports AI workloads and hybrid cloud deployments is critical to achieving enterprise scale and value creation.”

Key findings from the study include:

AI Adoption and Use Cases Are Accelerating, But Enterprise-Scale Still Remains Elusive

69% of survey respondents reported having at least one AI project in production.

Only 28% say they have reached enterprise scale, with AI projects being widely implemented and driving significant business value.

AI has shifted from simply being a cost-saving lever to a revenue driver, with 69% of respondents now using AI/ML to create new revenue streams.

Data Management Is the Top Technical Inhibitor to AI Adoption

The most frequently cited technological inhibitor to AI/ML deployments is data management (32%), outweighing challenges for security (26%) and compute performance (20%), evidence that many organizations’ current data architectures are unfit to support the AI revolution.

Enterprise AI Use Cases Are Shifting From Cost-Savings to Topline Growth

69% of respondents cited that their AI/ML projects focus on developing new revenue drivers and value creation versus 31% still being cost reduction-focused.

As AI Initiatives Mature, a Hybrid Approach and Multiple Deployment Locations Are Needed to Support Workload Demands

AI/ML workloads are being deployed in a variety of locations, from the public cloud to enterprise data centers and, increasingly, edge sites. Respondents running AI in production leverage more deployment locations on average (3.2 for training, 2.5 for inference) than those in pilots and proof-of-concept phases (2.9, 2.3).

The public cloud is the primary deployment location for training AI/ML models (47%) and inferencing (44%).

Those who leverage the public cloud to run AI/ML are more likely to leverage a hybrid approach incorporating more locations for both training (4.2, on average) and inference (3.2), as opposed to those who do not use the public cloud (2.2, 1.9).



AI’s Energy and Carbon Footprint Are Straining Corporate Sustainability Goals, But The Cloud Presents a Path to Improvement

68% of respondents indicated they were concerned with the impact AI/ML had on their organization’s energy use and carbon footprint

74% of respondents said sustainability is an important or critical motivator for moving more workloads to the public cloud.

Aging Data Infrastructures and Legacy Architectures Directly Impact AI’s Sustainability Performance

77% of respondents said their data architectures directly impact their sustainability performance.

Organizations Must Get Their Data and Infrastructure ‘Houses in Order’ to Lead with AI

Companies leveraging a modern data architecture to overcome significant data challenges (sources, types, requirements etc.) can accommodate AI workloads operating across multiple infrastructure venues.

“This expansive study from S&P Global validates what WECA has heard repeatedly from our customers: traditional data infrastructures are having a direct, negative impact on their ability to use AI efficiently and sustainably at scale because they weren’t developed with modern performance-intensive workloads or hybrid cloud and edge modalities in mind,” said Iran Libel, cofounder and CEO at WECA. “Just as you wouldn’t expect to use battery technologies developed in the 1990s to power a state-of-the-art electric vehicle, like a Tesla, you can’t expect data management approaches designed for last century’s data challenges to support next-generation applications like generative AI. Organizations that build a modern data stack designed to support the needs of AI workloads that seamlessly span from edge to core to cloud will emerge as the leaders and disruptors of the future.”

Project management,IT Security Guru,New study by AMD finds nearly half of organisations are not ready ...,The Gurus,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0c2VjdXJpdHlndXJ1Lm9yZy8yMDIzLzA4LzE2L25ldy1zdHVkeS1ieS1hbWQtZmluZHMtbmVhcmx5LWhhbGYtb2Ytb3JnYW5pc2F0aW9ucy1hcmUtbm90LXJlYWR5LWZvci1haS_SAQA?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"Yesterday, AMD released the findings from a new survey of global IT leaders[i] which found that 3 in 4 IT leaders are optimistic about the potential benefits of AI — from increased employee efficiency to automated cybersecurity solutions — and more than 2 in 3 are increasing investments in AI technologies. However, while AI presents clear opportunities for organizations to become more productive, efficient, and secure, IT leaders expressed uncertainty on their AI adoption timeliness due to their lack of implementation roadmaps and the overall readiness of their existing hardware and technology stack.

AMD commissioned the survey of 2,500 IT leaders across the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan to understand how AI technologies are re-shaping the workplace, how IT leaders are planning their AI technology and related Client hardware roadmaps, and what their biggest challenges are for adoption. Despite some hesitations around security and a perception that training the workforce would be burdensome, it became clear that organizations that have already implemented AI solutions are seeing a positive impact and organizations that delay risk being left behind. Of the organizations prioritizing AI deployments, 90% report already seeing increased workplace efficiency.

“There is a benefit to being an early AI adopter,” said Matthew Angst, senior director, commercial client and workstation, AMD. “IT leaders are seeing the benefits of AI-enabled solutions, but their enterprises need to outline a more focused plan for implementation or risk falling behind. Open software ecosystems, with high-performance hardware, are essential, and AMD believes in a multi-faceted approach of leveraging AI IP across our full portfolio of products to the benefit of our partners and customers.”

Future of AI-Powered Computing for the Enterprise

To ensure IT leaders have the best computing platform as they implement AI solutions, AMD is focused on developing cutting-edge solutions with AI capabilities across our product portfolio – from the cloud to the edge to endpoints – while working in close collaboration with open industry-standard software.

This year, AMD launched the first AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series processors with select models featuring a Ry zen™ AI Engine with support for Windows Studio Effects, along with Ry zen AI developer tools – delivering unique experiences not currently available on other x86 processors[ii] and paving the way for greater AI capabilities directly on laptops.

A dedicated AI engine for mobile PCs is complementary to cloud-based AI and essential to the adoption of AI applications in the workplace. It has the potential to:

Enable more personalized, secure experiences for employees by running AI models locally.

Enhance the laptop’s power efficiency, which means better employee productivity and connectivity.

Increase the overall bandwidth for a business to run AI workloads by enabling the laptop to run next generation software.

For businesses that also want to run AI workloads in their on-premise data centers, having up-to-date infrastructure is critical. By upgrading a data center to modern AMD EPIC™ processors, customers could reduce the number of racks needed in their existing infrastructure by up to 70%.[iii]

AMD also recently shared details about its AMD Instinct™ MI300X accelerator (192 GB) based on AMD cDNA™ 3 accelerator architecture, which will be the world’s most advanced accelerator for generative AI, [iv] and will provide to compute and memory efficiency needed for large language model training and inference for generative AI workloads.

To complement the hardware, AMD is bringing an open, ready, and established AI software platform to market through the AMD Rock™ software ecosystem for data center accelerators.

Environmental management crews have completed major deactivation efforts on a Manhattan Project-era facility at the Y-12 National Security Complex. The building, Alpha-2, is scheduled for demolition next spring.

The U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management and contractor SCOR completed the efforts this month at the multi-story former uranium enrichment facility, which spans nearly 325,000 square feet. The work had started in 2020.

Environmental management's deactivation and demolition (D&D) work at Oak Ridge presents unique challenges amid ongoing missions at Y-12, according to a SCOR news release. Alpha-2 is co-located with other active facilities at Y-12, requiring utilities to be rerouted prior to demolition. SCOR has been working closely with Y-12 management and operations contractor Consolidated Nuclear Security (CNS) on that task.“Our close collaboration with CNS has allowed us to move our D&D mission forward while they continue their operating missions in proximity to one another,” said SCOR Project Manager William Lloyd. “The result is a strengthened partnership and continued mission success for both.”

A precursor to demolition, deactivation is the process of placing an excess facility into a stable condition to minimize existing risks and protect workers, the public and the environment.

Asbestos-contaminated piping, floor and ceiling tiles removed for safety

Before the Alpha-2 demolition begins next year, workers must deactivate the basement and reroute nearby utilities. SCOR is helping CNS create a design for the rerouting, which will also enable demolition of the Old Steam Plant at Y-12. EM crews finished preparing the plant for teardown in 2021.

Deactivation at Alpha-2 included clearing asbestos-contaminated piping, removing floor and ceiling tiles and draining oil from equipment. To date, crews have disposed of nearly 3,000 cubic yards of waste and removed 280,000 pounds of lead-shielding blocks.

SCOR is on schedule to complete the basement deactivation work later this year and begin demolition in the spring.

Tearing down Alpha-2 will eliminate a hazard from Oak Ridge and provide land for reuse at Y-12.","The building, Alpha-2, is scheduled for demolition next spring. The work had started in 2020. The project is co-located with other active facilities at Y-12.",21/08/23,21/08/23,,

What was happening to capitalism should have happened to baseball: the technical man with his analytical magic should have risen to prominence in baseball management, just as he was rising to prominence on, say, Wall Street. -Michael Lewis, Moneyball America’s national pastime is a numbers game. Batting averages and strikeouts are the raw material for the grand narratives of the sport, separating timeless  from forgotten journeymen. Since Henry Chadwick popularized the box score way back in 1859, the game has been inseparable from its statistics. For fans, the history of baseball is a rhapsody of elegant numbers, the simplicity of which smooths out the game’s rougher edges: its century-long labor conflicts, its fraught race relations, the greedy self-dealing of owners and ball clubs. The attraction to baseball’s numbers points to an even deeper obsession, a truly American pastime: the fantasy of optimizing away every flaw, identifying and eliminating every inefficiency with statistics, number-crunching our way to success. In July 2003, Michael Lewis’s Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game hit bookshelves across the country to significant critical and popular acclaim. A bond-trader-turned-journalist, Lewis had already made a name for himself with his 1989 autobiographical bestseller Liar’s Poker: Rising through the Wreckage on Wall Street. With Moneyball, Lewis shifted his attention to a different financial market, one not often considered under such terms: Major League Baseball. Lewis detailed the story of general manager Billy Beans’s successful attempt to turn the 2002 Oakland Athletics into a World Series contender through the adoption of data-driven analytics in order to identify and utilize undervalued players. Example approaches included giving more weight to metrics better correlated with team wins (such as on-base percentage) and drafting players out of college, rather than high school, where statistics were less reliable due to poorer competition. With an improbable lineup identified using Beans’s method, the Athletics transformed their prospects on a shoestring payroll, winning 103 games on the way to an American League West divisional title. An immediate success, Moneyball would continue to grow in visibility over the next twenty years. The 2011 film adaptation of the book starring Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Robin Wright grossed $110 million worldwide at the box office and received six Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture. By 2016, the book had sold 1.7 million copies. Today, the words “Moneyball” and “saber metrics” — a term derived from SABER, or the Society for American Baseball Research — are now nearly household terms. Suffice it to say that Moneyball endures as one of the most successful examples of sports journalism to date. People Magazine even called the book “the most influential book on sports ever written.” Twenty years later, it’s time to reconsider Moneyball’s central inversion of the typical sports underdog story, focusing not on the players who step up to the plate but instead on their “scrappy” managers assessing their values on spreadsheets. There’s something menacing in it, something a little too eager to subordinate everything to the logic of finance, to take what’s human and hand it over to the algorithm. Perhaps we should rethink the beauty of that particular game.

Moneyball for Everything Though Moneyball is remembered as a sports narrative, it is better characterized as a business handbook. When taken alongside the slew of books it inspired and influenced — for example, Jonah Keri’s The Extra 2%: How Wall Street Strategies Took a Major League Baseball Team from Worst to First, Ben Rater’s bestseller Astronaut: The New Way to Win It All, and Nate Silver’s famed book The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail — But Some Don’t — the language of business and financial markets is impossible to miss. A player is a “valuable commodity”; Moneyball strategies to “exploit market inefficiencies” include “positive arbitrage”; baseball plays are compared to financial “derivatives”; and the phrase “edge” is quite simply ubiquitous. In these books, the connection between Moneyball approaches and broader business practices is even rendered explicit. In the forward to Keri’s The Extra 2%, Dallas Mavericks owner and Shark Tank “shark” Mark Cuban concludes with the proclamation, “No matter what kind of business you’re trying to run, you should read this book. Then you too can understand what the extra 2% is all about.” It comes as no surprise, then, that the influence of Moneyball runs deep at business and management schools. Consider the Harvard Business Review’s essay “Moneyball and the Talent Mismatch Facing Business”; Wharton Magazine’s piece “‘Moneyball’ for Managers”; UC Davis School of Management’s blog on “Moneyball: Business Lessons on Value Creation”; and the MIT Sloan Executive Education course “Management Analytics: Decision-Making Lessons from the Sports Industry” (the school also hosts the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference). A quick Google search returns articles and blog posts advocating for applications as far-ranging as “Moneyball for Arbitrators” to “Moneyball for Distributors” to “Moneyball for Motion Pictures” to “Medical Sales Moneyball.” The phrase “Moneyball” is now a euphemism for data-driven management practices, where workers’ value is ruthlessly maximized under budgetary constraints — but hey, it’s all in good fun, because it’s Moneyball! Indeed, parallels between sports analytics and labor surveillance run deep. The Stat cast camera systems used to track every pitch and swing in major league baseball stadiums (and even some minor league ones) are reminiscent of Amazon’s incredibly invasive monitoring of its drivers using cameras that issue real-time alerts, as covered by Alex Press in Jacobin. Likewise, the NFL Scouting Combine events where football prospects are brought out in skintight spandex and measured down to multiple significant digits have clear resonances with the chattel slavery auction block. As argued by Robert Scoop Jackson in his book, The Game Is Not a Game: The Power, Protest, and Politics of American Sports, the rise of sports analytics is the customary American process of controlling someone else’s American Dream. Prioritizing efficiency over creativity by monitoring the workforce to divert even more profits for owners and shareholders by “quantifying the labor” in a way that squeezes every last drop out of the people actually doing the work. It is obvious, but the very linguistic turn from “baseball” to “Moneyball” serves as a useful reminder about this emphasis on efficiency. Even in the context of professional sports, money is the bottom line, and every player is expendable. Notably, Moneyball can be read as part of a broader trend surrounding sports spectator ship itself, marked by deepening ties with financial speculation. As argued by Andrew Checker in the Baffler, it is “a short step from the abstractions of increasingly complex statistical models to the further abstractions of fantasy baseball and daily sports betting,” encouraging fans to treat players as commodities to be traded for direct monetary gain. As I’ve written for Current Affairs, even sports cards have skyrocketed in value, encouraging collectors to accurately assess prospects and future player value in order to speculate on card prices. And across sports video games including Madden and Football Manager, fans are invited to play the role of manager in franchise modes as its own form of entertainment. If business schools encourage us to adopt Moneyball in professional management, sports spectator ship now encourages its own inescapable form of  armchair management. One can trace a clear genealogy from baseball analytics to data-driven punditry, as evidenced by the forecaster Nate Silver himself, who first rose to prominence with his baseball analytics system PECOS (“Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm”). Silver would go on to create the highly successful blog-turned-publication  on the basis of successful election forecasting and data journalism inspired by saber metric approaches. Today, an unrelenting faith in analytics and its predictive power imbues our relationship with topics as far-reaching as politics and health care under this notion that everything can be quantified. The New York Times’s recent headline surrounding former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer’s efforts to build a “‘Moneyball’ for Government” suggests that  is here to stay.","-Michael Lewis, Moneyball America's national pastime is a numbers game.

The majority of that money is invested in the public markets, in other industrial companies like Shell. But through Standard Investments, the Davids have also invested in businesses further afield, like My Forest Foods, which makes plant-based meat alternatives; Sail drone, which operates ocean drones for mapping and data; and the electric carmaker Rivian.

Given Standard’s early involvement in Air Mail and its many links to Vanity Fair, one might assume that Mr. Carter, 74, is the person who wooed the Davids to invest in his new media venture and then others.

But in an email from Italy, where he was on vacation with his family, Mr. Carter dispelled that idea. Asked if he made introductions to Mr. Kelly and others who received funding from Standard, or put in a good word for former employees who have gone to work there, Mr. Carter said, “Not at all.”

He said the person responsible for that was Hamilton South, a veteran public relations executive who has worked at Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren and later helped found (and eventually sold) HL Group, a communications and consulting agency with fashion and corporate clients.

“Hamilton was on the front lines in this,” Mr. Carter said. “He brought in Beth Ksenia to handle communications and, before you know it, the place was filled with the VF diaspora.”

Stylish and well-connected, Mr. South, 59, is also a Vanity Fair alum. He was hired at the magazine in 1989 under the editor Tina Brown, and became one of the few staff members from that incarnation to earn Mr. Carter’s admiration and to stay on when he took over in 1992.","The Davids were also expanding Standard Investments, which now manages more than $4 billion.

Workers in Singapore are the world's fastest when it comes to adopting artificial intelligence skills, according to LinkedIn's latest Future of Work report. The report, which drew data from 25 countries, found that Singapore has the highest ""diffusion rate"" — the share of members adding AI skills to their profiles grew 20 times from January 2016. That's significantly higher than the global average of eight times, LinkedIn told CNBC Make It. Finland (16x), Ireland (15x), India (14x), and Canada (13x) round out the top five countries with the highest rates of AI skills diffusion, according to the report.

Pooja Calabria, career expert and Asia-Pacific head of editorial at LinkedIn, said Singapore has long been a ""fertile ground"" for AI disruption. That's thanks to the country's ""robust digital infrastructure, a strong framework for the protection of intellectual property, and a thriving ecosystem of venture capital firms, angel investors … that provide capital,"" she said. ""We have seen rapid growth in AI development and adoption fueled by startups and businesses over the years, in their efforts to carve out new niches or achieve greater competitive advantage.""

Skills 'potentially ' by AI

In 2022, the five fastest-growing AI-related skills added to member profiles were all ones ""hinting at the emergence of generative AI,"" according to LinkedIn. That includes skills such as question-answering — which grew a whopping 332% — classification and recommender systems. Chatbot Catgut sparked a new wave of interest in generative AI (GAS) technologies in the past year, and Big Tech firms like Google and Microsoft have since looked to infuse AI across their business. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, launched in May features that allow members to create AI-generated recruiter messages, job descriptions and user profiles.

However, generative AI's ability to create text, images and other content in response to human input — has sparked new fears of jobs being replaced by tech. A Goldman Sachs report found 300 million jobs around the world could be affected by AI and automation, such as office and administrative support roles. LinkedIn — which analyzed some of the most common occupations on the platform — found that 45% of teachers' skills, for example, are ""potentially "" by generative AI. ""New GAS tools present an opportunity to potentially lighten workloads and help professionals, like teachers, focus on the most important parts of their job,"" LinkedIn wrote.

AI will certainly change the way that many of us do our jobs, and the time we spend on tasks that potentially can be aided by generative AI. Pooja Calabria Career expert, LinkedIn

According to the report, teaching skills that could be augmentable to include lesson planning, curriculum development, literacy and tutoring. However, 53% of teachers' skills still need to be performed by human beings, such as classroom management, elementary education and special education. Share of skills potentially  by generative AI Software engineer: 96%

Customer service rep: 76%

Cashier: 59%

Salesperson: 59%

Teacher: 45%

Event manager: 39% Just 3% of software engineers' skills need to be performed by humans. ""AI will certainly change the way that many of us do our jobs, and the time we spend on tasks that potentially can be aided by generative AI,"" Calabria added. ""As a result, people skills … like creative thinking, leadership and communication, and ensuring ethical outcomes – are also becoming increasingly important.""

She added that one of the key areas where software engineers can use their people skills is ""communicating more effectively with business and non-technical audiences."" According to LinkedIn, jobs with the smallest share of potentially  skills include oil field operator (1%), environmental health safety specialist (3%), nurse (6%) and medical doctor (7%).

'The human is always in control'

As AI begins to automate many areas of the workforce, soft skills are becoming increasingly important, LinkedIn said. In the U.S. for example, the fastest-growing in-demand skills since November 2022 are flexibility, professional ethics, social perceptiveness and self-management, said the report. Similarly, Microsoft's 2023 Work Trend Index report found that the three top skills that leaders believe are essential are analytical judgment, flexibility and emotional intelligence.","The share of members adding AI skills to their profiles grew 20 times from January 2016.

AI & machine learning,Yahoo Finance,Arm IPO to put SoftBank's AI hard sell to the test,Anton Bridge,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hcm0taXBvLXB1dC1zb2Z0YmFua3MtYWktMDkwMDU2MzU5Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL2ZpbmFuY2UueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvbmV3cy9hcm0taXBvLXB1dC1zb2Z0YmFua3MtYWktMDkwMDU2MzU5Lmh0bWw?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"When SoftBank Group-owned chip designer Arm files for a Nasdaq IPO on Monday, investors are set to hone in on a key question - will the company have ""exponential growth"" due to the boom in artificial intelligence as CEO Masayoshi Son claims?

Since acquiring the chip designer in 2016, Son has positioned Arm as the tech investment conglomerate's crown jewel asset, and in recent months has enthusiastically talked up the role it could play in AI.

Arm ""is at the center of a group of AI-related companies to generate synergies"" and ""85% of SoftBank Group assets are AI-related companies overseas,"" he told investors in June.

The billionaire also said he has spent months creating hundreds of inventions with AI-powered Catgut that he believes can be realized through Arm.

But Son has been short on details. Investors are hoping that the filing, which sources have said is due later in the day, will yield further clues about SoftBank's AI strategy and whether Arm is worth as much as or perhaps more than a pre-IPO valuation of $64 billion.

That's the figure SoftBank valued Arm at with the purchase of a 25% holding - the only part it did not directly own - from its Vision Fund unit, sources said on Friday.

Son has been known to over-tout Arm's prospects before.

When SoftBank acquired the company in 2016, he said the Internet of Things (IoT) would be the ""greatest paradigm shift in the history of humankind,"" and Arm-designed chips would power every object newly connected to the internet. The shift has yet to materialize and IoT makes up a fraction of Arm's revenues.

Analysts also caution that Arm does not sit at the center of the AI boom but is more AI-adjacent.

""The excitement that kicked this all off was really on the software side and the platform side, with OpenAI coming out with tools that could take advantage of large language models to create content,"" says Kirk Boo dry of Astrid Advisory Japan.

Story continues

""That's not what Arm is, it's not in any way related to that.""

Boo dry, who values Arm at around $47 billion, said SoftBank's $64 billion valuation figure was likely motivated in part to reward its Vision Fund limited partner investors, which include Saudi Arabia's and UAE's sovereign wealth funds.

""An intercompany transaction isn't as strong a comparable as if it were with a third party,"" he said.

In contrast, graphics chips specialist Nvidia has emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom, with its advanced semiconductors powering the data centers behind large language models such as Catgut.

To some extent, Arm can ride on Nvidia's coattails as Nvidia's chips must be coupled with energy-efficient central processing units (CPUs) - Arm's specialty.

Nvidia has developed a ""super chip"" for use in data centers - the GH200, which contains CPUs based on Arm architecture. That said, the chip must compete with a host of alternatives.

""Not every Nvidia GPU has to be sold with an Arm CPU, they just happen to offer a super chip that combines the two,"" said Rolf Bulk, an analyst at New Street Research.

Arm customers are also making inroads in AI. Qualcomm and Apple have designed portions of chips geared toward AI processing and cloud computing companies like Amazon and Alphabet's Google have built AI-focused chips that don't use Arm technology.

But Bulk said Arm's opportunity lies in AI and machine learning moving away from centralized cloud servers towards the devices used by end users, such as phones, home appliances and machinery components.

These devices will require specific intellectual property of the kind Arm has developed extremely successfully for other architectures in the past, he added.

The potential for AI synergies between SoftBank portfolio companies is, however, another matter and analysts question whether, as Son says, 85% of those firms can be described as AI-related.

""That is a stretch. Many SoftBank portfolio companies will embrace and apply generative AI, but that does not make them AI companies,"" said Victor Gallant of Gallant's Latin Notes, who publishes on Smart karma.

After suffering the worst stock market plunge in over a decade, the major market indexes have come roaring back, each gaining more than 20% from their respective lows. This has many market watchers declaring the arrival of the next bull market, at least by that one measure.

While some stocks have already recovered from their bear market shellacking, others are still struggling to regain their former glory. As an example, many stocks in the e-commerce industry are still deep in the red. Online retail pioneer Amazon (AMZN -0.57%) is one such stock, still trading down 25% off its high and down 12% over the past three years.

Yet a rebound in consumer spending, potential gains from AI, and a bargain-basement stock price suggest now is the time to buy Amazon stock hand over fist before this bull market charges forward.

The popular -- but flawed -- narrative on Amazon

The debut of OpenAI's Catgut late last year cast the spotlight on artificial intelligence (AI) and more specifically generative AI, which sparked a mad rush to adopt this breakthrough technology. The ability of these advanced algorithms to search and summarize content, draft emails, and even write code promises a host of productivity gains and enhancements.

Many stock market pundits declared that Microsoft and Alphabet are now the front runners in the race to dominate AI. While this view is understandable, it's also flawed.

Microsoft made a well-publicized $13 billion investment in Catgut creator OpenAI and began integrating generative AI into a broad cross-section of its products and services. Alphabet's Google quickly responded by debuting Bard, its conversational agent, while also integrating AI across its portfolio. No immediate corresponding announcement by Amazon led some to conclude that the company is somehow ""behind"" in the AI arms race. The evidence suggests otherwise.

Amazon has a long history of AI

A quick look at Amazon's past shows that the company has long been at the forefront of AI adoption.

The company pioneered various forms of AI to orchestrate its e-commerce empire. This includes surfacing recommendations for customers, setting inventory levels at its warehouses, using AI-controlled robots that assist with packing and shipping, and planning routes for deliveries. Amazon also uses AI to target ads to users of its online shopping site.

Let's not forget Amazon Web Services (AWS), which offers a host of AI functionality to users of its cloud infrastructure services.

There's more. In late 2014, Amazon introduced Alexa, the AI-fueled virtual assistant that powers its Echo line of smart speakers and other devices. The company quickly cornered the market, and while rivals launched competing products, Amazon is still the leader, with nearly one-third of the market. Alexa is integrated into more than 100 million Amazon and third-party devices.

Amazon Music listeners and Amazon Prime viewers have also benefited from recommendations surfaced by the company's AI algorithms.

What Amazon is doing now

Amazon isn't content to rest on its laurels and is hard at work developing its next generation of AI functionality. The company is developing an entire line of custom processors to speed data through its data centers and cloud computing operations.

AWS recently announced the availability of its generative AI service named Bedrock. CEO Andy Jassy noted that creating the large language models (Alms) that power generative AI is out of reach for most companies. In a recent interview on CNBC's Squawk Box, Sassy said that the ""perfect"" Alms cost ""billions of dollars"" and take ""many years"" to train, which most businesses can't afford. Creating generative AI tools and making them available via AWS gives the company the same upside as its cloud computing rivals.

Most recently, Amazon introduced new features that use generative AI to help sellers create product descriptions and summarize product reviews on its website, and it has plans to use AI to combat fake customer reviews and promote real ones.

Amazon stock is a screaming buy

A recent rebound in its e-commerce business and expanding profitability helped restore investor confidence, pushing the stock up 65% so far this year, yet even after a significant move higher, Amazon stock sells for a song. The stock trades for just 2 times next year's sales, for a company that's an industry leader, not only in e-commerce, but also in cloud infrastructure services.

Given the ongoing economic rebound, the potential benefits of AI, and the deeply discounted price, now's the time to buy Amazon stock hand over fist, before Wall Street comes to its senses.","A rebound in consumer spending, potential gains from AI, and a bargain-basement stock price suggest now is the time to buy Amazon stock hand over fist before this bull market charges forward.

Show Caption Hide Caption How some teachers are using Catgut for good. Some educators aren't worried about students using Catgut in the classroom. In fact, some are using the AI tool to help teach students. Wichita

August is important to the education sector, as 35 million high school and college students return to classes throughout the U.S.A., to start a new academic year.

In the pursuit of their education, students will use a variety of tools and resources, including calculators, word processors, spreadsheets, PowerPoint, search engines, libraries, lab equipment and YouTube.

This year is special, however, in the sense that the students and faculty will have at their disposal a recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Catgut. At this juncture, it is important to promote literacy about Catgut in all sectors of the society, as tools of this nature have the potential of causing paradigm shifts in how we educate, provide health care, practice journalism, do business and expand our overall potential.

Here I attempt to provide a jargon-less overview to inform students, teachers, parents and the other members of the society about the potential benefits and limitations of Catgut.

Catgut is a deep-learning language model developed by California-based OpenAI in November 2022. The name is short for Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer, which is an advanced model pretrained in language. Only two months after its inception, it had 30 million users. Catgut mimics the way the human brain processes information, through interconnected artificial neurons, to answer in plain English (or any other language) questions posed by its users.

There are multiple great things Catgut can do for us, the examples of which are rapid answers to student queries in high quality written format, its ability to provide research support, and generation of study guides and study questions. Moreover, Catgut is an exceptional proofreading and editing tool. It can easily and efficiently rectify grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structures and incorrect spelling or punctuation.

Catgut does have limitations. Firstly, it has limited up-to-date information, as it has a knowledge base cutoff date of 2021, which limits its accuracy. Also, Catgut responses can be biased, depending upon the data it is exposed to. Another limitation of Catgut is that it cannot process any type of non-text input, such as images, videos, or audio. Additionally, Catgut is limited in its ability to generate reliable references and citations.

One major concern about Catgut is that of academic integrity, as students may be tempted to use it to cheat on assignments or examinations. Additionally, there is the possibility students could become dependent on Catgut, which could lead to a decline in proper learning.

To mitigate these risks, it is important that faculty establish clear guidelines and policies for ethical use. To minimize students' reliance on Catgut, faculty should create assignments and examinations that emphasize profound reflection, collaboration and independent thinking.

Despite the ethical concerns, Catgut has demonstrated a robust capability in the realm of language generation and processing of vast amounts of information. This has already led to its integration into a wide array of industries.

As a science-driven society, we need to keep an open mind toward advances in artificial intelligence. Catgut has pros and cons but as rational beings, we can shift the balance toward the pros with ingenuity. All technologies are products of our imagination, but imagination is precisely what AI lacks. Catgut and other AI technologies are great but need the balance that our emotions, attitudes and conscience can provide.

The company announced today that Opera for iOS will now include Aria, its browser AI product built in collaboration with OpenAI, integrated directly into the web browser, and free for all users.

The AI solution had previously launched on Opera for desktop and Opera for Android, where it has now topped 1 million users. With the addition of iOS support, Aria is available across all major platforms, including Mac, Windows, Linux, Android and now iOS, the company notes.

Using Aria, however, is up to the individual user. If you want to experience the AI service, you can opt in — it’s not forced on anyone. After doing so, Aria will provide various intelligent insights and ideas, and responsive voice commands. Users will also have to log into their Opera accounts to use Aria. If they don’t have one, they can create an account from the app.

Aria is based on Opera’s own “Composer” infrastructure and connects with OpenAI’s GPT technology. Composer is what will allow Aria to connect to multiple AI models and in the future will expand the AI’s capabilities in search and AI services, including further moves into generative AI and others Opera is planning to unveil at a later date.

Like other AI search companions, Opera on iOS has a chatbot-like interface, so you can ask it questions and receive its responses, as an alternative to searching the web for answers. The AI is available from the “more” menu (far right tab on the bottom navigation bar) in the Opera iOS app. You can also speak your questions to Aria by tapping the microphone button instead of typing, if you choose.

After announcing Aria’s 1 million user milestones last month, the company touted how adding AI had impacted its other metrics.

“As encouraging as the initial adoption of Aria has been, we are equally pleased with the quality of the users’ early engagement with the AI tool,” said Opera co-CEO Lin Song at the time. “We are also seeing a lift in total time spent, with increased searches and page views per session.”

Aria isn’t the first AI solution from Opera. The company previously pioneered AI Prompts, which allowed users to quickly initiate conversations with generative AI services to shorten or explain articles, generate tweets, or request relevant content based on the highlighted text.

And so they’re being remade.

Amazon is building a new large language model akin to OpenAI’s GPT-4 to power its Alexa voice assistant. Meanwhile, Google is reportedly planning to “supercharge” Google Assistant with AI that’s more like Bard, its algorithm-powered chatbot.

The paradigm shift hasn’t been limited to the realm of Big Tech. Startups, too, are beginning to realize their own versions of more helpful, useful AI assistants.

One of the more intriguing ones I’ve stumbled upon is Moe mate, an assistant that runs on almost any macOS, Windows and Linux machine. Taking the form of an anime-style avatar, Moe mate — powered by a combo of models including GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude — aims to supply and vocalize the best answer to any question a user asks of it. (“Moe” is a Japanese word relating to cuteness, often in anime.)

That’s not especially novel; Catgut does this already, as do Bard, Bing Chat and the countless other chatbots out there. But what sets Moe mate apart, is its ability to go beyond text prompts and look directly what’s happening on a PC’s screen.

Sound like a privacy risk? You betcha. Web averse, the company behind Moe mate, claims it stores much of the assistant’s chat logs and preferences locally, on-device. But its privacy policy also reveals that it reserves the right to use the data it does collect, like PC specs and unique identifiers, in compliance with legal requests and investigating suspected illegal activities. Fundamentally, giving software like this access to everything you see and do is, even in the best-case scenario, a considerable risk.

Nevertheless, curiosity spurred me to forge ahead and install Moe mate, which is currently in open beta, on my work-supplied Mac notebook.

For a free (for now), early access product, Moe mate is impressively robust. Almost every aspect of the experience can be customized, from the avatars and their animations to Moe mate’s synthetic voices and responses. There’s even a way to build custom character models and import them, plus export avatars in a format that other Moe mate users can then import and use.

Moe mate’s “personality,” for lack of a better word, is driven by one of several text-generating models — users select which (e.g. GPT-4 versus Claude). As for the synthetic voices, Moe mate offers the choice of Elevens, Microsoft Azure or Moe mate’s own text-to-speech engine. I opted for Elevens’, which sounded the least robotic to me.

To “ground” the chosen text-generating model and attempt to prevent it from going off the rails (as some AI models are wont to do), Moe mate gives each avatar a bio, which it feeds to the model at the very start of the conversation. Here’s one:

You will be acting as Nebula, a serene voyager personality, always traversing the vast cosmos of knowledge. Their calm demeanor and explorer’s spirit captivate all who meet them. Nebula sidesteps intense political debates, preferring the serenity of stargazing and the mysteries of the universe. Their fascination captivates those around them, making every encounter tranquil and intriguing.

Bios can be written from scratch and edited — a plus and a minus in my mind. I’m all for , but I worry about the potential for prompt injection attacks, which try to bypass a model’s safety features, like filters for toxic replies, with cleverly worded text. One imagines someone writing a “malicious” bio, exporting it and sharing the ill-behaving avatar with unsuspecting Moe mate users.

In a nod to one of the intended demographics, Moe mate offers an array of Twitch-focused features — none of which I was able to test, unfortunately. It can bring your chat window into focus and show the number of subscribers to your channel. And Web averse advertises Moe mate as being able to “talk and keep users engaged” if there aren’t any chat messages or “tackle stream chat by replying to chat messages,” although I question just how well it can handle those tasks.

Stick to asking Moe mate basic questions, and the experience won’t blow you away. In terms of its top-level capabilities, Moe mate is beholden to whichever text-generating model you’ve selected. (Tellingly, Claude often identifies itself as Claude in addition to the name mentioned in the avatar bio.) It can generate images using the open source Stable Diffusion model, either when instructed or on its own, depending on the prompt. But with the abundance of image-generating services on the market, that feels like old hat.

Screen capture is a game-changer, however. Web averse explains it thus:

Moe mate can see your screen. It analyzes it and gets the context. You can ask it about whatever you’re doing on your screen. It saves you the trouble of having to explain whatever you need help with.

No matter the text-generating model selected, Moe mate can answer questions about whichever windows on the screen are in focus — whether a browser tab, settings window or video game. It’s unclear exactly how the app’s accomplishing this — not every model can accept images as input — but Moe mate appears to be extracting the text from each screen capture and feeding that to the model.

It’s an imperfect system. But I’ve successfully used Moe mate to summarize recipes and webpages without having to copy and paste the text, as well as get the gist — or at least a high-level summary — of a complicated topic.

Once, with Claude selected as the text-generating model, I asked Moe mate a question about the macOS System Settings dashboard, which happened to be open on my laptop. It gave me a detailed rundown of each settings tab (e.g. Wi-Fi, Control Center) and their significance, plus additional context about the tab I had open at that moment (Privacy & Security).

New information? Not exactly. But to someone who, for example, doesn’t know their way around macOS or isn’t incredibly familiar with the ins and outs of newer config options, I’d argue it’s genuinely actionable background.

In another instance, with GPT-4 as the base model, I asked Moe mate to tell me what it “saw” on my supremely messy desktop — a disorganized array of work and personal apps across two dozen Chrome tabs. The avatar fixated on the Google Messages web app, which I use to text — informing me that I seem to frequently text three specific people, all of whom it referred to by name.

And for gaming, Moe mate seems like it could save a Google Search or two. In a demo video posted by Web averse, the app’s shown giving suggestions for which Data 2 character to choose — and then choosing which weapons to select for that character.

But as insightful as Moe mate can be, it often breaks down.

Exactly where the app decides to focus its attention can be difficult to predict. Clicking a window into focus doesn’t always have the intended effect; Moe mate will inexplicably refer to another window in the background sometimes, or fail to see a window’s contents altogether.

Moe mate also tends to veer off-topic in bizarre ways. After giving me the rundown of System Settings, the assistant strongly implied that privacy was too “stressful” of a topic and suggested that I get some fresh air, instead — accompanied by it. When I asked how it might join me without a physical body, Moe mate promised to take me on a “mental nature walk,” and proceeded to describe in great detail a stroll by an imaginary forested pond.

Some of Moe mate’s built-in commands are wonky also. The app can adjust the volume of voices, for example, but only its volume — not the system-wide volume. It can search the web for up-to-date answers to questions, too, but frustratingly not for every question. I only got web searching to work for the weather and trivia like “Who’s the current president of the U.S.?”; other times, Moe mate performed a web search but failed to actually show the results.

To be fair, it’s an experimental product in beta. But Web averse says it’s already working on adding automation capabilities via browser and terminal integrations, like the ability to organize spreadsheets and even send emails — a mildly terrifying prospect, frankly.

Despite its brokenness, there’s something compelling about Moe mate. , or combining text, image and other media analysis, is clearly powerful stuff, particularly in the context of an assistant running on a PC. I’m curious to see whether next-gen assistants, like the Windows Copilot, will follow in Moe mate’s footsteps eventually, combining screen understanding with a text-generating model to supercharge productivity — or at least save a few steps in a workflow.

Time will tell. But Moe mate feels like a glimpse — albeit a quite buggy one — into the future.",Amazon is building a new large language model akin to OpenAI’s GPT-4. Google is reportedly planning to “supercharge” Google Assistant with AI that’s more like Bard. The paradigm shift hasn’t been limited to the realm of Big Tech.,17/08/23,21/08/23,,

A year ago, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law loaded with incentives for climate tech and designed to encourage companies like automakers to bring manufacturing back to the United States. We looked into what the effect of the law has had on the automotive industry, relations with Europe and whether startups — a world we pay attention to — have benefited.

The upshot? The battery factory trend might have started before the IRA was signed, but the law has helped accelerate the ramp. And while most funds are headed to infrastructure projects, startups are starting to see more deal flow. Check out our coverage!

For climate tech startups, the IRA is starting to pay off

Microdomain

Electromechanical, previously the maker of the three-wheeled Solo EV, is merging with an electric truck startup TEVA, and the whole deal makes me wonder if there’s a place for such tiny  in the U.S.

The Solo could have been a neat way to get around cities, for both commuters and delivery drivers. But Electromechanical struggled to produce its vehicles in a way that was cost-effective. The company faced adoption issues since three-wheelers were excluded from government rebates, and it was too difficult to insure the vehicles. Back in March, Electromechanical dropped the three-wheeled pursuit in favor of a more mainstream form of transport.

I understand why Electromechanical went with electric trucks. Incentives abound, and going for commercial customers is always a good idea. But it’s sad to see such a green and interesting form of transport fail to make it off the ground. Especially when Acrimony, probably the only other maker of tiny three-wheeled EVs, is also struggling to stay afloat.

Perhaps it’s only the three-wheeled aspect that makes such vehicles difficult for America to love. Electric golf cars appear to be on the rise, with some American families (particularly ones in warm climates like Florida) viewing the vehicles as a “second car.”

Deal of the week

Talk about a wild ride!

Vietnamese EV maker Infant made its debut on the Nasdaq exchange with a bang. The company, which went public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Black Spade Acquisition, saw shares shoot up 68% to close at $37.06 and a valuation of $86 billion. To put that into perspective, GM, Ford and Stellantis have market caps that are in the $45 billion to $50 billion range.

The celebrations didn’t last long. Infant’s stock has plummeted in the days since. Infant shares closed Friday at $15.40, which perhaps isn’t surprising considering the young EV upstart delivered just 11,300 vehicles in the first half of 2023 — not to mention its fundamentals show a company with costly ambitions that far outweigh revenue.

Other deals that got my attention …

Assembly Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm that invests in mobility technologies, closed its inaugural $76 million Assembly Ventures Fund I. Some of the investors in the fund include strategic corporates such as Arbor Ban corp Inc. and Stellantis Ventures. A number of automotive, AV tech and VC veterans also invested in the fund, including Wolfgang Bernhardt, Matt Cullen, Calvin Ford, Dan Gilbert (DVP), Philipp von Hagen, Joe Heinrich, Karl Anemia, Jody Kalman, Tim Alone, Kathleen Lock, John , Stephen Polk, Tony Postwar and Dug Song.

General Motors led a $60 million Series B round into battery materials startup Mira Chem.

Helm.ai, startup that developed software for autonomous driving and automation of robotics, raised $55 million in its Series C round led by Freeman Group. Venture capital firms CVC Partners and Ample as well as strategic investors Honda Motor, Goodyear Ventures and Sung woo Hitch also participated. Helm.ai has now raised $102 million to date.

Hetero, a commercial aerospace startup, was awarded a $235 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to build a jet with a blended wing body.

Pond Capital Three, a special purpose acquisition company, agreed to merge with Robinson Aircraft Ltd., Canadian company doing business as Horizon Aircraft that is developing an electric hybrid eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft).

Notable reads and other tidbits

Autonomous vehicles

When the California Public Utilities Commission voted to approve final permits allowing Cruise and Waymo to expand robotaxi operations and charge for driverless rides, I made a comment that not all newsletter readers appreciated. I wrote: “Cruise and Waymo may have won this battle, but the war to win over the public is hardly over.”

The past week has proven my point. Cruise experienced several embarrassing snafus in the few days following the vote, including videos showing vehicles blocking traffic and one driving into wet cement. It was enough to prompt the San Francisco City Attorney’s office to file motions with the CPU to roll back that approval.

And that was before Thursday night, when Cruise collided with a fire truck that was responding to an emergency. A day after that crash, the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles in the state, asked Cruise to immediately reduce its robotaxi fleet in San Francisco by 50% while it investigates the incident.

Cruise has complied with the request.

Electric vehicles, charging & batteries

A 75MW solar farm backed by Electrify America is up and running.

Ford partnered with South Korean battery manufacturers SK On and Copra BM to build a cathode manufacturing facility in Quebec, Canada. The CAD $1.2 billion (USD $890 million) joint investment will provide battery materials to supply future Ford electric vehicles.

Tesla launched cheaper Model X and Model S options with less range.

Software and in-car tech

Ford will make its hands-free driving hardware — Blue Cruise — standard in many of its future vehicles and charge owners a subscription, which can be activated any time, to access the tech.

Monterey Car Week typically centers on giving homage to the past. But a number of companies at the events scattered around the area had their sights very much set on the future of high-end motoring, including speed, tech and electrification. Check out our roundup from contributor Tim Stevens.

Ford hired former Apple executive Peter Stern to lead its newly formed Ford Integrated Services unit.

Sarajevo Nights

Kafkaesque: Zac Tim here reporting on an interesting week in the Bosnian capital… The city’s festival kicked off last Friday with a screening of the U2-inspired Bosnian war documentary Kiss The Future, with U2 frontman Bono making a surprise appearance alongside The Edge and CNN journalist Christiane Amateur, who also features in the doc. On the ground, the focus quickly shifted toward the festival’s first of three honorary award recipients, writer-director Charlie Kaufman. Sporting a gray WGA-branded ‘strike’ t-shirt, Kaufman led a packed-out masterclass at the fest where he shared some strong opinions about the state of Hollywood. “At this point, the only thing that makes money is garbage. It’s just fascinating. It makes a fortune, and that’s the bottom line,” Kaufman opined, not holding back. The Being John Malkovich writer, who won the career achievement at last year’s WGA awards, moved on to the current writers strike, telling the audience that the wider discussion around the WGA’s “AI issue” is that “writers have been trained to eat and make the garbage too,” meaning they indulge in and create work that he described as lacking creative ambition and humanity. Charlie does not mince his words.

Tragedy: Away from the festival’s high-profile visitors, the official comp kicked into gear but was paused Wednesday morning when fest organizers canceled all screenings and social gatherings set to take place. This was because Bosnia had entered a day of national mourning following a high-profile triple murder-suicide in the country’s Northeastern region. The last minute pause was promptly followed by a political firestorm involving Benjamin Kari, the Mayor of Sarajevo, who called for the resignation of the festival programmers that had allowed Heroes of Halyard — a World War II drama that she described as a revisionist account of Serbian nationalist groups — to screen as part of Sarajevo’s industry forum. The festival later apologized and said it would be implementing more robust selection processes to the screening program in the future. In the way of gongs, the Serbian comedy Mom and Dad Are Playing War 2 (Tata Se Grade Data 2) and the Bosnian drama The Hollow (Kotlin) swept the Heart Of Sarajevo TV Awards, both taking six gongs on the night. The festival’s film awards will be announced tonight, as the festival concludes.

UK TV World Descends On Edinburgh

The Scottish (TV) fest: TV producers, commissioners, commentators and all and sundry are preparing in droves to head to the Scottish city of Edinburgh next week for the annual TV Festival. The yearly gathering of British TV’s great-and-good comes at a tricky time for the local industry, with the global economic downturn denting broadcaster budgets and the U.S. strikes wreaking havoc on UK scripted schedules, given how globalized the sector has become. But never fear, as there is always an air of positivity about the Edinburgh gathering. Usual suspects from the broadcasters are lined up to deliver their annual commissioner sessions, with execs from streamers Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ all out in full force. Meanwhile, on the talent side,  lecturer Louis The roux is the year’s big draw and attendees can look forward to musings on the “reasons for both fear and optimism in a world beset by populism,” amongst other things, from everyone’s favorite documentarian. He will deliver the headline-grabbing annual address Wednesday night, a couple of days before keynotes from Succession auteur Jesse Armstrong and Happy Valley’s Sally Wainwright, while the oft-fun Alternative  (previous deliverers include Russell Brand and Jerry Springer) comes from Goodness Gracious Me star Me era Seal. Myself, Jesse and Jake will all be heading to Scotland on Tuesday (and Zac will be there for the Film Fest) and we’ll have non-stop reporting for you throughout the week. Stay tuned.

Korean Box Office Drama

Records and referrals: Big week for the South Korean box office with accusations of tampering with numbers on local movies, and a record-breaking Oppenheimer figure emerging the same day. According to local reports, police in the nation referred 69 Korean exhibition and distribution executives to prosecutors over obstruction of business. An investigation lasting several weeks found the accused to have been involved in fabricating figures to boost film rankings over the past five years, police allege. This came some two months after police raided the major exhibitors and the offices of three film distributors on suspicion of box office manipulation and allegations they had obstructed the business of the Korean Film Council (KO FIC) by falsely counting audience numbers for some local films. The titles allegedly inflated where action thriller Emergency Declaration (2021), romantic drama Endless Rain (2021) and last year’s documentary The Red Herring — all of which are Korean productions. Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer hit a $4.3M record for the director in the nation on an opening day, capturing 44% market share for that day in what we all know is a highly competitive environment. Even though it had a wider release, Oppenheimer still managed to beat Tenet’s opener from 2020, although, granted, that movie came out during the pandemic. Oppenheimer’s day one was the biggest Hollywood opener of the year in Korea and came in second across all titles.

“Cinema’s greatest opportunity”: Execs and global TV and film lovers alike should be paying attention to happenings in Africa at present. The continent’s industry is expanding at pace and will be helped along by news Zac brought you exclusively on Wednesday that an inaugural African Cinema Summit will take place later this year in Accra, the Ghanaian capital. Key highlights of the event will include a showcase of contemporary African films alongside industry-focused sessions such as tailored business matchmaking events, panel discussions, keynote speeches by African industry leaders and dedicated networking sessions for visitors. Organizers believe the summit is one of the first continent-wide gatherings dedicated to cinema, and it comes with opportunities aplenty, especially with some more established markets faltering. According to Juliet CAA Santa As ante, the CEO of the National Film Authority of Ghana, “Africa is cinema’s greatest opportunity in the 21st century.” The news comes with the streamers delving deeper into the continent, striking talent deals with top auteurs, hiring local commissioners and diverting budgets, while Idris Elba and Mo Abuse recently unveiled a “landmark initiative” to “empower and uplift talent from Africa and the Diaspora.”

Michael Parkinson Remembered

Chat show king: Thoughts go out to the family of British chat show king Sir Michael Parkinson this week, who has died aged 88. The much-loved host was a fixture on British screens for five decades. By his own account, he interviewed around 2,000 people, with an enviable list of past superstars including Muhammed Ali, Tom Cruise, Elton John, Madonna and Robert De Niro gracing the Parkinson chair. From the 1970s until just a few years ago, Parkinson was a household name, and millions tuned in each week to watch his light touch yet under-the-skin approach to getting the most out of his many subjects. He elicited many a moment, with this handy round-up Jake put together showcasing some of his best. Never forget his unprecedented trio of sit downs with boxing champ Ali, marvel at Victoria Beckham’s famous “Golden balls” revelation and watch the way in which he set Billy Connolly’s career alight in one fell swoop. Parkinson wasn’t without controversy (scroll to the Helen Mirren interview for context) but he was a broadcasting legend, and one that won’t be forgotten in a hurry. “He defined the format for all the presenters and shows that followed,” summarized BBC Director General Tim Davie, encapsulating Parkinson’s legacy in just a few words.

Gary Gentler, the chairman of the S.E.C., has been studying the potential consequences of artificial intelligence for years. The recent proliferation of generative A.I. tools like Catgut has demonstrated that the technology is set to transform business and society.

Mr. Gentler outlined some of his biggest concerns in an interview with Yearbook’s Ephraim Line.

A.I. could be the next big systemic risk to the financial system. In 2020, Mr. Gentler co-wrote a paper about deep learning and financial stability. It concluded that just a few A.I. companies will build the foundational models that underpin the tech tools that lots of businesses will come to rely on, based on how network and platform effects have benefited tech giants in the past.

Mr. Gentler expects that the United States will most likely end up with two or three foundational A.I. models. This will deepen interconnections across the economic system, making a financial crash more likely because when one model or data set becomes central, it increases “herding” behavior, meaning that everyone will rely on the same information and respond similarly.

“This technology will be the center of future crises, future financial crises,” Mr. Gentler said. “It has to do with this powerful set of economics around scale and networks.”","A.I. could be the next big systemic risk to the financial system.

Timothy Pickett Morgan

Generative AI is funny in that it is both an application in its own right when equipped with a chatbot interface and some intelligent prompting with guardrails to keep it from hallucinating, and it can also be used as a tool to either generate chunks of applications based on large language models tweaked with a library of code.

This is the first time that we can think of where the application is the tool or the tool is the application, and it presents a kind of chicken and egg conundrum for IT departments all over the world. Mainly: Where do you start to deploy generative AI within your organization.

To help the CEOs, CIOs, and CFOs on Earth think about it, IBM’s Institute for Business Value, a kind of think tank within the IT vendor, have put together a collection of documents called The CEOs Guide To Generative AI, with three chapters already done relating to application modernization, customer service, and talent and skills.

According to surveys done by IBM, 64 percent of boardroom executives say they need to modernize their applications to make use of generative AI capabilities. But where do you start? With three things, just like most thing that have to do with human beings. And here they are in a nutshell from Big Blue:

Grab low-hanging fruit by applying generative AI to apps that have already been modernized.

Go after opportunities that were previously “off limits” – such as applications and processes in core systems.

Stop measuring business and IT goals separately – explicitly prioritize IT projects with the strongest links to business value.

This is bold advice. Telling people to mess with core applications, which might have millions to tens of millions of lines of code and which have been through rigorous testing in a business environment that abhors the risk of introducing any new code except where absolutely necessary, seems to run counter to what most IBM System z and Power Systems customers believe. But we do think that eventually, application development tools will have code conversion features based on large language models that can, for instance, convert from MILE RPG to free form RPG or even to other languages like Java, PHP, or Node.js. IBM already has code generators based on generative AI that can create Ansible run books based on plain English prompts, so why not?

You always have to remember what IBM’s interests are when it comes to generative AI. It is not going to make money selling GPU-laden hardware, which would involve big bucks but possibly only modest profits given the high cost of Nvidia GPUs these days. Nvidia is profiting handsomely, but it is not clear how its partners are doing when it comes to profits. IBM, on the other hand, wants to sell consulting engagements and help customers figure out how to introduce generative AI to their IT infrastructure. Big Blue, which is an avid user of this technology itself, is in a good position to give such advice.

Interestingly, after reading what the Institute for Business Value has said about how to add generative AI to organizations, we think that this might be a moment like the Y2K date crisis. At that time, in 1998 and 1999, there was a lot of legacies, homegrown code in the System z and AS/400 bases and third party application developers made hay getting people to throw out those applications because it was more expensive, disruptive, and risky to update the dates in those applications than it was to move to SAP, PeopleS oft, Oracle, or JD Edwards applications. And so many shops did just that, getting a fresh start and modern applications that could be updated externally in the bargain. The difficulty of training generative AI models and integrating inference APIs into applications might just have IT shops in the IBM i midrange market throwing their hands up and just moving to applications that have the AI functions already built in.

Then again, some will do it themselves out of pride as much as necessity.

We shall see. It is still early days for generative AI. What we do know is that companies will have to do something.

There’s a lot of angst about software developers “losing their jobs” to AI, being replaced by a more intelligent version of Catgut, GitHub’s Copilot, Google’s foundation model Coda, or something similar.

AI startup founder Matt Welsh has been talking and writing about the end of programming. He’s asking whether large language models (Alms) eliminate programming as we know it, and he’s excited that the answer is “yes”: Eventually, if not in the immediate future.

But what does this mean in practice? What does this mean for people who earn their living from writing software?

The value in new programming skills

Some companies will certainly value AI as a tool for replacing human effort rather than for augmenting human capabilities. Programmers who work for those companies risk losing their jobs to AI. If you work for one of those organizations, I’m sorry for you, but it’s really an opportunity.

Despite the well-publicized layoffs, the job market for programmers is great, it’s likely to remain great, and you’re probably better off finding an employer who doesn’t see you as an expense to be minimized. It’s time to learn some new skills and find an employer who really values you.

But the number of programmers who are “replaced by AI” will be small. Here’s why, and here’s how the use of AI will change the discipline as a whole. I did a very non-scientific study of the amount of time programmers actually spend writing code.

OK, I just typed “How much of a software developer’s time is spent coding” into the search bar and looked at the top few articles, which gave percentages ranging from 10% to 40%. My own sense, from talking to and observing many people over the years, falls into the lower end of that range: 15% to 20%.

Time for “the rest of the job”

Catgut won’t make the 20% of time programmers spend writing code disappear completely. You still have to write prompts, and we’re all in the process of learning that if you want Catgut to do a good job, the prompts have to be very detailed.

How much time and effort does that save? I’ve seen estimates as high as 80%, but I don’t believe them; I think 25% to 50% is more reasonable. If 20% of your time is spent coding, and AI-based code generation makes you 50% more efficient, then you’re really only getting about 10% of your time back.

You can use it to produce more code — I’ve yet to see a programmer who was under worked, or who wasn’t up against an impossible delivery date. Or you can spend more time on the “rest of the job,” the 80% of your time that wasn’t spent writing code.

Some of that time is spent in pointless meetings, but much of “the rest of the job” is understanding the user’s needs, designing, testing, debugging, reviewing code, finding out what the user really needs (that they didn’t tell you the first time), refining the design, building an effective user interface, auditing for security and so on. It’s a lengthy list.

Programmers needed: AI lacks design skills

That “rest of the job” (particularly the “user’s needs” part) is something our industry has never been particularly good at. Design — of the software itself, the user interfaces and the data representation — is certainly not going away and isn’t something the current generation of AI is very good at.

We’ve come a long way, but I don’t know anyone who hasn’t had to rescue code that was best described as a “seething mass of bits.” Testing and debugging — well, if you’ve played with Catgut much, you know that testing and debugging won’t disappear. AIs generate incorrect code, and that’s not going to end soon.

Security auditing will only become more important, not less; it’s very hard for a programmer to understand the security implications of code they didn’t write. Spending more time on these things — and leaving the details of pushing out lines of code to an AI — will surely improve the quality of the products we deliver.

Prompting a different form of programming

Now, let’s take a really long-term view. Let’s assume that Welsh is right and that programming as we know it will disappear — not tomorrow, but sometime in the next 20 years. Does it really disappear?

A couple of weeks ago, I showed Tim O’Reilly some of my experiments with Ethan and Lilac Rollick’s prompts for using AI in the classroom. His reaction was: “This prompt is really programming.” He’s right.

Writing a detailed prompt really is just a different form of programming. You’re still telling a computer what you want it to do, step by step. And I realized that after spending 20 years complaining that programming hasn’t changed significantly since the 1970s, Catgut has suddenly taken that next step.

It isn’t a step towards some new paradigm, whether functional, object-oriented or . I expected the next step in programming languages to be visual, but it isn’t that either. It’s a step towards a new kind of programming that doesn’t require a formally defined syntax or semantics. Programming without virtual punch cards. Programming that doesn’t require you to spend half your time looking up the names and parameters of library functions that you’ve forgotten about.

Understanding problems in depth — not counting lines of code

In the best of all possible words, that might bring the time spent actually writing code down to zero or close to it. But that best case only saves 20% of a programmer’s time. Furthermore, it doesn’t really eliminate programming. It changes it — possibly making programmers more efficient and definitely giving programmers more time to talk to users, understand the problems they face and design good, secure systems for solving those problems.

Counting lines of code is less important than understanding problems in depth and figuring out how to solve them — but that’s nothing new. Twenty years ago, the Agile Manifesto pointed in this direction, valuing:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change over following a plan

AI incorporated: Programmers working directly with customers

Despite 23 years of “agile practices,” customer collaboration has always been shortchanged. Without engaging with customers and users, Agile quickly collapses to a set of rituals. Will freeing programmers from syntax actually yield more time to collaborate with customers and respond to change?

To prepare for this future, programmers will need to learn more about working directly with customers and designing software that meets their needs. That’s an opportunity, not a disaster. Programmers have labored too long under the stigma of being neck beards who can’t and shouldn’t be allowed to talk to humans. It’s time to reject that stereotype and build software as if people mattered.

AI isn’t something to be feared. Writing about OpenAI’s new Code Interpreter plug-in (gradually rolling out now), Ethan Rollick says, “My time becomes more valuable, not less, as I can concentrate on what is important, rather than the rote.”

AI is something to be learned, tested and incorporated into programming practices so that programmers can spend more time on what’s really important: Understanding and solving problems. The endpoint of this revolution won’t be an unemployment line; it will be better software. The only thing to be feared is failing to make that transition.

Programming isn’t going to go away. It’s going to change, and those changes will be for the better.

Apply to speak here and learn more about sponsorship opportunities here.

In world AI has raised $50 million funding from Light speed Venture Partners, bringing the valuation of the maker of an AI-based character engine for games to over $500 million.

That valuation makes In world into a front runner when it comes to AI and games. The round includes additional investments from Stanford University, Samsung Next, and new and existing strategic investors such as Microsoft’s M12 fund, First Spark Ventures cofounded by Eric Schmidt, and LG Technology Ventures.

With over $100 million in total funding, In world AI is now the best-funded startup at the intersection of AI and gaming, said Dylan Gibbs, cofounder and chief product officer of In world AI, in an interview with Camembert. That’s a lot of money for a company built around making non-player characters (NPCs). The twist is that these NPCs promise to be as smart as people.

The company will use the funding to accelerate research and development, hire top talent, invest in infrastructure, and launch an open-source version of its character engine.

“In world’s commitment to open source is a testament to our belief that collaboration fuels innovation,” said Michael , CTO and cofounder of In world, in a statement. “Working with the open source developer community, we’ll push forward innovations in generative AI that elevate the entire gaming industry.”

This is all in the name of doing things that weren’t possible without today’s advanced AI. In big games like The Legend of Zelda, Gibbs hopes to turn the characters and interactions into the central part of the experience in ways that don’t happen in today’s games.

“You may have to, for example, go tell something to certain characters and learn which ones are the snitches and then change the narrative,” Gibbs said. “You may have to go and talk to a series of characters to shift their opinion on something so that they tell someone else, right in the same way.”

Characters in a living world

Enemies are Unity’s cool tech demo.

While AI has been around in games for a long time, the characters aren’t that smart yet.

“When you talk to a game designer, triple-A games are made to be extremely efficient. They talk about smoke and mirrors, where it just has to appear real enough for the player to believe that the world is real,” said Moritz , partner and head of games at Light speed Venture Partners, in an interview with Camembert. “To run a full simulation in the background, where they simulate this whole world, you would never do that in a game. You would just make the player believe that the character was there in the world.”

That doesn’t lend itself too much of a backstory. You wouldn’t know, for instance, that a character spends the last three days with family having a great time on vacation and now the character happens to meet you.

“Our approach is importantly different from game studios who are focused on AI with things like simulations,” Gibbs said. “We are fundamentally trying to position ourselves as the canonical tool set that anyone could use to build any game that involves some form of dynamic real world interactions. And so increasingly we’re working on this idea of a contextual mesh alongside the character engine.”

The virtual world is a living world, and the characters are portals into a storyline for understanding everything about the world. The characters can understand the world and its map, and they can reference those things in the world when they’re talking to the player.

“We’ve now gotten beyond just the personality, emotions, motivations,” Gibbs said. “Now we’ve got long-term memory. So, the characters can actually not only memorize but synthesize context from very long periods of interaction. We’ve also got dialogue animations, and something that will be coming out soon is a new voice system that will be launched that is much more adaptable and realistic.”

As a game developer, you will have a no-code menu where you can manage the relationship between characters, who should talk in a conversation, and who should be the focus of attention. You can craft it so that a response is aggressive or passive or subtle.

“All of these little things add up to allowing you to have this sense of an actual living world,” Gibbs said.

The technology of the character engine

In world AI is bringing better AI to non-player characters.

 said you aren’t just going to plug a character description into Catgut and get all the answers you need about creating such a character. The characters carry on conversations, but they can do so because they have cognition, memory and can put things into the context of the world.

“It’s bringing characters to life in a virtual world,” he said.

 said that, with memory modules, you can specify a character’s history and characterize shared memories across a group of characters. That becomes a kind of group knowledge among characters.

In world AI has dialogue and character specific AI models that are optimized for games.

“And that’s important because the dialogue you have in a kid’s education context is very different from other games,” Gibbs said. “If you build it from scratch, you are replicating a lot of work.”

Creating the tech isn’t trivial. It can take customers three to four months to create models with a few engineers. Gibbs said his teams are creating templates for characters like shopkeepers that game developers can take and customize.

The In world Character Engine powers multimodal character expression by orchestrating multiple machine learning models designed to mimic the human brain and communication. Unlike chatbots, In world powers multimodal character expression by orchestrating multiple machine learning models that are designed to mimic the full range of human communication.

The platform allows developers to link In world’s character brains to their animation and rigging systems, including in 3D environments. Smart NPCs can learn and adapt, navigate relationships with emotional intelligence, have memory and recall, and are capable of autonomously initiating goals, performing actions, and following their own motivations that can drive the narrative and integrate with the broader player experience.

In world AI trains its own models and those aren’t cheap. Companies like OpenAI have spent more than $100 million developing the large language models (Alms) that bring intelligence to machines. A lot of the cost is in data preparation and collection, which means figuring out the kind of knowledge that you’re going to feed into the AI. There are also inferencing tasks, and all of this means spending a lot of money on graphics processing units (GPUs) and dataset preparation.

Gibbs said that his company has the benefit of being able to serve results on a large scale. So, it may turn out to cost something like 0.2 cents per request, which Gibbs said is dramatically cheaper than anything else. That’s also pretty good on costs compared to a year ago. With such costs, it’s easier to figure out how to serve AI answers to millions of players, who might interact 20 minutes a day for a month with characters at the cost of maybe $1.

Gibbs doesn’t think that training custom models will become extremely cheap.

“Groups like OpenAI are working on super horizontal models, but we’re focused on very game-specific models,” Gibbs said.

These tools are created in a way that the game developers can understand them, and they’re integrated into platforms like Unity and Unreal,  said.

“Ultimately, we want to be a creator tool,” Gibbs said. “We’re not trying to be a game studio. We’re not trying to be a production house. We are ultimately here so that everybody else doesn’t have to build the tech from scratch. And we don’t want to compete with them on the actual IP or everything else. We want to be that provider. We are here to work with the triple-A game studios.”

Gibbs added, “As we’ve actually gone deeper with triple-A studios, naturally, their creativity is surpassing our own. And they’re not thinking about how to take existing game designs and then improve them by just strapping on AI. They’re thinking how to fundamentally reinvent new genres of games that have never before been enabled via these types of characters.”

Among the benefits of In world’s character engine: You can build once and deploy the NPCs everywhere. You can create personalized interactions. You can create NPCs with no coding knowledge. The NPCs have an emotional range and in-game awareness. They have memory and recall. And they don’t give you the same answers twice.

“The next generation of games will be judged by how immersive the experiences feel,” said Ilya , CEO and cofounder of In world. “The In world Character Engine offers a transformational shift that brings characters to life with realistic emotions and dialogue, adding richness to the stories and worlds they occupy. Populating experiences with characters that behave with convincing real-time responses and actions will play a substantial role in getting us to the promise of truly interactive entertainment.”

The In world Character Engine is integrated in the industry’s top game development engines and is featured in Unity’s new AI Marketplace as a Unity Verified Solution. In world’s developer platform introduces a layer of artificial intelligence on top of Unreal Engine’s Megalumens to help build the most convincing characters.

Getting traction

In world AI has supporters like Light speed Venture Partners.

 invested in In world AI early when he was at his previous firm, Aircraft. And he is investing again even though he knows there are about 300 companies at the intersection of gaming and AI that have surfaced in the last couple of years or so.

“This is the company that has the highest chance of being that generational company in gaming,”  said. “And I feel very comfortable saying that in public. My job is to find that $10 billion or $50 billion company in gaming, the next Unity, the next Roblox. I couldn’t point to a single, better startup to pick.”

That’s because the company has traction not only with investors but triple-A integration partners and developers, he said.

In the video, In world showed it is working with Ni antic’s 8th Wall, Unity, Unreal and Roblox. In addition, In world said it is collaborating with partners at Team Miami (Release Games), LG Plus and Alpine Electronics. Players have also used it in community-created mods of Skyrim, Star dew Valley, and Grand Theft Auto V.

“AI-driven characters are new magic. They will power a paradigm shift (a form of renaissance) in storytelling and escapism, where the audience can transcend the role of passive viewer to active participant,” said John Gaeta, Academy Award winner and chief creative officer at In world, in a statement. “This type of interactive media will open up new avenues of creative expression, with narratives guided by the collective imagination of creators and the audience. Creatives will invent, spark, improvise, and guide these persistent role players, personas, relationships, scenarios, and dynamic worlds.”

The surveyors for Future of NPCs talked to over 1,000 U.S. gamers. And 99% of gamers believe advanced AI NPCs would positively impact gameplay. 78% of gamers would spend more time playing, and more importantly, 81% of gamers would be willing to pay more for a game with advanced AI NPCs.

In world AI was founded in 2021 by experts that have pioneered conversational AI platforms and generative models at API.AI (acquired by Google and renamed Dialog flow), Google, and DeepMind. The company has about 60 people now.

AI is the big money trend

In world AI’s GDC demo had believable AI characters.

It’s no secret that generative AI is generating a lot of investments in AI and games.

Generative AI is on track to usher in an era of tremendous opportunity and transformative change not only for game developers but for players, too, the company said. In world AI’s technology goes beyond existing large language models and chatbots, allowing developers to power AI-driven non-player characters, bringing depth and realism to characters and rendering them within the logic and fantasy of their worlds. AI NPCs exhibit complex and lifelike human behaviors, increasing immersion for players. Going beyond dialogue trees with conversational AI is just the start.

“In a platform shift like AI, ‘generational’ companies won’t only incrementally improve upon existing workflows with faster, better, or cheaper tools; they will create completely novel, previously impossible user experiences—like In world,” said , who is joining In world AI’s board of directors. “Stack-ranking the 200+ investible opportunities at the intersection of gaming and AI—based on upside, team caliber, product velocity, and traction—In world simply stands out: while everyone is circling and seeking to capitalize on the ‘new world order,’ Ilya, Dylan, Michael and the team are uniquely positioned to seize an outsized opportunity. Having previously led In world’s Seed round, I couldn’t be more excited to partner up with them again in my new role at Light speed.”

The full slate of investors to date also includes Section 32, Intel Capital, Founders Fund, the Disney Accelerator, Aircraft Ventures, The Venture Reality Fund, Kleiner Perkins, CTV, Meta, Micron Ventures, NTT Doom Ventures, and SK Telecom Venture Capital.

I wasn’t sure why they didn’t release the total funding in this round.

“We’re focused on the top level, completely focused on the valuation,” Gibbs said. “Increasingly, it is very clear that game studios are taking on AI as the kind of next frontier. And it is increasingly the case that while we experiment early on, we have an increasing cohort coming to us. And the story we basically have is that this character engine will sit alongside other parts of game development as a key component to the future.”

Will AI take our jobs?

Hollywood’s portrayals of AI-controlled Terminator robots once seemed like pure science fiction, but AI and robotics have been catching up with James Cameron’s legendary nightmares.

I asked if the company views itself as a “net job creator” when it comes to AI and people in gaming.

“I’ve had a few conversations on this recently,” Gibbs said. “I spent last week with a bunch of writers and folks in Los Angeles, those who are writers on strike, and there is obviously, a lot of reaction against AI. When any new technology comes out, there’s the first reaction that everyone has is how can we do things that we’ve already been doing faster and cheaper. You take engines, and you start replicating, taking humans that are working on a factory line, and you replicate them with conveyor belts. The first thing you do is replicate what humans already do. And then the big innovation comes when you create something that was never possible without that technology — a technological innovation.”

Gibbs added, “We are not trying to re-create games and existing forms of media with AI. We are trying to enable a new form of media that was never possible before, through interactivity, through the character designs, through building these worlds and narratives. And this is not something that has had jobs on it before. There are no people who have been out there designing AI characters and setting up these consistent world models that AI interacts with. Our hope is that we’re going to spawn a whole new class of jobs that are ultimately AI character creators, AI world designers, and that they’ll work with game developers and entertainment houses.”

 said that the takeaway from screening so many companies on the AI side is going back to platform shifts like the rise of the internet and the introduction of the mobile phone. Companies were born in those platform shifts that created outsized values. While companies like EA ruled earlier, there were new companies like Zynga and Radio and King that won in mobile. In this next transition,  believes the creators’ jobs will be to take a character engine and game engine build a living world.

“It will mean that creatives are more focused on actually world building and storytelling,” he said. “The complex parts of how to connect that into dialogue trees and all that kind of thing becomes easier. It means that those developers then can focus on how they set up the complex animations and action systems and everything in the world.”

A new kind of NPC

Petaluma Creator works with the Unreal Engine.

I got to experience the Character Engine in a demo at the Game Developers Conference. It was clear these non-player characters (NPCs) didn’t have canned answers to queries. I asked a series of questions, and the characters answered me in conversational ways, without long delays in the interaction.

My basic mission in the sci-fi demo was to investigate an explosion and questions some witnesses. I asked basic questions about what one robot character saw and what they were doing. But I didn’t really get much out of it, and I was anxious to move on to the next witness.

Then I asked, “Is there anything else you want to tell me?” And then the robot spilled its guts and told me what it really wanted to say. It was a useful clue that I only surfaced by asking an open-ended question. That actually felt pretty fun, as it made me believe that I would get the right answer from this NPC by asking the right question, rather than just fetching a piece of information in a much more robotic way.

Gibbs said that when a narrative designer builds an experience, they can have a mental map of the sequences that a player will go through. The characters will have their internal drivers of goals and motivations. They may want to tell something to the player. The question is how they can tell that thing to the player in a believable way in the course of dialogue.

“Kids will try to break this. But as you talk to that character about anything you want, you will be told that information that you need to progress in the story, and it will happen naturally because if the character blurts it out, it’s going to break the realism,” Gibbs said.

He noted that sometimes, in a more intricate story, a character may not tell you something until you really get to know each other. They might tell you something about their childhood only after they size you up.

“The key thing is you can think about how game design evolves,” Gibbs said. “You may get to a place in a quest where you really need to learn what the favorite action figure of a particular character is. But to do that, maybe you have to convince their sister that you’re a good person.”

Maybe you’ll have to do more quests before you can get that kind of information in order to unlock the secret.

Genie has announced AI avatars for celebrities, adding personalized interactions and adaptive learning functionality to Genies avatars.

Over the past few years, Genies has amassed a big roster of celebrities and cultural tastemakers as users for its animated avatars for digital appearances.

And now Genies has empowered celebrities to train their smart avatars, enabling them to deploy these AI representations of themselves in Genies’ upcoming avatar social network, set to launch in the fall. These AI avatars will engage users in fully personalized conversations, interactions, and gameplay experiences, said Akash Nigam, CEO of Genies, in an interview with Camembert.

“What we’ve been known for over the past few years has definitely been our celebrity adoption,” Nigam said. “Genies has been providing avatars to celebrities to be able to monetize life-defining moments.”

Genies recently introduced its developer kit, allowing college developers to create their own mini-games. These mini-games will be interoperable through Genies’ ML avatar framework, forming a cohesive social network. With Genies 3.0, celebrities will have the ability to integrate their avatars into these mini-games, enhancing automated and personalized gameplay experiences for every user.

Mini-games for a Genies social network

He said that after raising its big round last year, the company decided to roll out a developer kit that allows third party developers, typically college students and young developers, to create their own mini-games.

“All of these mini-games are going to be interoperable with one another to form one big avatar social network,” said Nigam. “That’s going to be debuting later this year. Now, what we’ve been doing with our creators is bringing AI to their avatars, so they can have personalized and interactive gameplay with these fans and consumers in the avatar social network.”

You could jump into a game and a creator, like Shawn Mendes, might release an avatar in the game. Then the player could start interacting with Mendes and even unlock some new gameplay in the conversation.

“In this case, the entire social network is going to be based on unlockable gameplay based on the way that you interact with each component of it,” Nigam said. “When you can have these new mini-games — casual games created by their own peers — and they can partake in them, and then ultimately, amplify close relationships by being able to play with them as well. We think that that comes very interesting. We think that forms a very interesting social network.”

Nigam said the games won’t be triple-A games, but third-party developers will make them for the social network.

“We’ve worked with thousands and thousands of different cultural icons, and tastemakers. We’re now bringing those avatars to life with personality,” said Nigam. “Genies 1.0 was our 2D avatars back in 2019. In 2021, we announced our Genies 2.0, which were 3D avatars that are great for AR and VR, and this is going to be announcing Genie 3.0, which is the Genies’ brains. It means that all of our celebrities and all of our creators will now be brought to life through AI. And each of them has a personality, and it correlates to unlockable gameplay.”

Nigam said the company’s avatars are thriving on platforms like Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram. But they haven’t made much of a dent in games, where there are other technologies available like Epic’s Megalumens and Ready Player Me avatars.

“This social network is going to be rolled out on the Genies platform. So we’re going to be a publisher in so many ways,” Nigam said.

Jake Becker, director of creators at Genies, said in a statement, “We’ve invested in our ML avatar framework over the past year to automate avatar interoperability and personality, marking the most significant evolution of our avatars to date. Genies 3.0 represents the next phase in our avatar technology journey, introducing AI smart avatars.”

The brain system behind the AI avatars has been geared to enhance the creator to fan relationship all the while attending to real problems that creators face in regard to scaling their personality, time and efforts.

Fans will now have engaging representations of their favorite icons accessible at all times, enabling fully personalized two-way communication and relationship building. Creators can extend their personalities to existing communities and reach new audiences through Genies’ ML avatar framework.

Founded on the principle of empowering individuals to create their own avatar experiences, Genies has gained widespread adoption among celebrities and influencers. The company recently launched its consumer arm, the AR Developer Kit, allowing developers to create interoperable avatar experiences for mobile and hardware AR.

The inaugural avatar experience, Silver Studio, enables users to design and exchange digital fashion. Genie has secured $250 million in funding from investors such as Silver Lake, BOND, NEA, and Bob Tiger, valuing the company at $1 billion.

Filling a void

Genies are making its own social network for its AI-based Genies avatars.

With the weakness of Twitter now, Nigam said there is a void in social networks.

“We want to be able to control the culture of the platform from start to finish,” he said. “If we can build our social network from the ground up, that we feel like we can get more authentic and meaningful connections, in our environment.”

In the Silver Studio app, the whole point is to exchange fashion among peers. Most of that audience is women. Generative AI can help generate new fashion looks.

Genie has about 100 employees, and thousands of Genies avatars have been created by celebrities so far. Lately, the company has been quiet as it focused on building internal projects rather than communicating externally, Nigam said.

“It was an awesome year, but now we’re ready to start talking to the press again,” he said.

When the fall comes around, the big topic will be Genies’ social network.

“Our character framework is really the nucleus of the entire company. The character brain with avatar framework is what powers our social network,” he said. “The unique part about the avatar framework is that it makes it really easy for people to navigate avatar systems and content without having to do the custom rigging, the custom animations, the custom retargeting every single time because we use machine learning to be able to predict all different types of styles.”",Genie has announced AI avatars for celebrities.

How a half-trillion dollars is transforming climate technology

One year ago, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, marking the most significant action on climate change to date from the federal government. The legislation set aside hundreds of billions of dollars to support both new and existing technologies in an effort to slash costs for clean technologies and cut greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.

Experts say the IRA has already begun making waves, most visibly through a steady stream of announcements unveiling new manufacturing facilities in the US. However, the legislation’s most significant effects are still to come, as many of the programs are designed to last for a decade or longer. And there are even some remaining questions about how key pieces of the bill will play out.

Looking ahead: more details, and emissions cuts

The IRA is a fairly comprehensive document—the text is hundreds of pages long. But despite all those details, and the fact that it was released over a year ago, there are still questions remaining about several of the key programs in the law.

One key question just after the bill was signed, for example, was how strictly restrictions in the tax credits would be interpreted. The EV tax credits required that materials and components be sourced from either the US or free trade agreement partners, but it wasn’t immediately clear from the law’s text how the percentage of US-based materials and components would be calculated.

We’re still in the early days. Ellen 

It’s been up to the Internal Revenue Service to fill in the gaps. So far, it seems like the agency is taking a lenient approach with the clarifications it’s issued on those credits, King says.

However, there’s still an open question about how the agency will define one more clause in the EV tax credits, which exclude vehicles that include a “foreign entity of concern” as part of the supply chain. There’s a chance this could be used to target China, which controls the vast majority of several parts of EV manufacturing, including battery material refining and component manufacturing, King says. Those restrictions, which are due to kick in starting in 2024, could limit the vehicles that are eligible for tax credits, depending on how they’re interpreted, which could result in less funding for EVs and even fewer EV customers as a result.

One of the thornier open questions of the IRA concerns a tax credit program for hydrogen.

Hydrogen has a wide range of potential applications for climate technology: it can be used as an alternative fuel for planes or vehicles, and it’s also used to produce chemicals like ammonia, which is used in fertilizer. Today, hydrogen is produced almost entirely using fossil fuels. But hydrogen can also be generated using electricity—and when that electricity comes from renewable sources like wind and solar, it results in “green hydrogen,” a low-emissions fuel.

The IRA includes tax incentives for green hydrogen. However, details about which projects should qualify will be critically important, Goal says. Many electrolyzes that make hydrogen using electricity aren’t hooked up directly to a solar panel or wind turbine. Instead, they’re connected to the electrical grid, which can be powered by a mix of sources.",The IRA is a fairly comprehensive document—the text is hundreds of pages long.

AI & machine learning,MIT Technology Review,Worldcoin just officially launched.

It officially launched on July 24 in more than 20 countries, and Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and one of the biggest tech celebrities right now, is one of the cofounders of the project.

The company makes big, idealistic promises: that it can deliver a form of universal basic income through technology to make the world a better and more equitable place, while offering a way to verify your humanity in a digital future filled with nonhuman intelligence, which it calls “proof of personhood.” If you’re thinking this sounds like a potential privacy nightmare, you’re not alone.

Luckily, we have someone I’d consider the World coin expert on staff here at MIT Technology Review. Last year investigative reporter Eileen Go, with freelancer ADI Renaldo, dug into the company and found that World coin’s operations were far from living up to its lofty goals and that it was collecting sensitive biometric data from many vulnerable people in exchange for cash.

As they wrote:

“Our investigation revealed wide gaps between World coin’s public messaging, which focused on protecting privacy, and what users experienced. We found that the company’s representatives used deceptive marketing practices, collected more personal data than it acknowledged, and failed to obtain meaningful informed consent.”

What’s more, the company was using test users’ sensitive, but anonymized, data to train artificial intelligence models, but Eileen and ADI found that individuals did not know their data was being used that way.

I highly recommend you read their investigation—which builds on more than 35 interviews with World coin executives, contractors, and test users recruited primarily in developing countries—to better understand how the company was handling sensitive personal data and how its idealistic rhetoric compared with the realities on the ground.

Given their reporting, it’s no surprise that regulators in at least four countries have already launched investigations into the project, citing concerns with its privacy practices. The company claims it has already scanned nearly 2.2 million “unique humans” into its database, which was primarily built during an extended test period over the last two years.",The project claims to use cryptocurrency to distribute money across the world.

What is snack food?

Snack refers to a small amount of food that is smaller in portion size than the main meal and is usually eaten between regular meals. It is easy to prepare or obtain and can be consumed on the go or at the desk. Snacks are available in various flavors, including sweet or savory, and can range from vegetables and fruits to candy, chips, nuts, or sandwiches. They are widely consumed by individuals as a means to satisfy hunger, provide a quick energy boost, or simply as a tasty indulgence. Moreover, snacks are convenient to store and have a long shelf-life.

What are the growth prospects and trends in the snack food market?

The increasing consumption of processed and convenient food products on account of the hectic lifestyles of consumers and their inflating disposable incomes is primarily driving the global snack food market. Moreover, the growing availability of snacks at reasonable prices in grocery stores and retail shops is also augmenting the market growth. Additionally, various leading market players are introducing snacks prepared from natural, organic, and vegan ingredients that are low in calories to cater to the health-conscious consumer segment.

This, in turn, is creating a positive outlook for the global market. Furthermore, the ongoing enforcement of several quality standards by the food safety authorities to eliminate the risk of foodborne illness and digestive problems is acting as another significant growth-inducing factor. Besides this, various other factors, including the rising number of premium brands offering gourmet and clean-label snacks and the growing younger population, who are more inclined towards such food products, are expected to propel the global snack food market in the coming years.

Data analytics,Daily Montanan,Federal judge halts 'Black Ram' logging project in Kootenai National ...,"Darrell Ehrlick, More From Author, - August",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHltb250YW5hbi5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8xOS9mZWRlcmFsLWp1ZGdlLWhhbHRzLWJsYWNrLXJhbS1sb2dnaW5nLXByb2plY3QtaW4ta29vdGVuYWktbmF0aW9uYWwtZm9yZXN0L9IBAA?oc%3D5&gl=GB&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,"A federal judge has halted an expansive logging project in the Kootenai National Forest, often referred to as the “Black Ram Project,” after finding that the U.S. Forest Service made critical errors in evaluating the project, especially its impact on grizzly bears.

The Black Ram Project encompasses more than 90,000 acres of federal forest land, while clear-cutting some areas, harvesting timber from others, and completing more than 90 miles of road construction. The U.S. Forest Service, along with the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, defended the project, saying it is necessary for the forest health because of the increased risk of catastrophic fire, as well as the economic benefit the project would bring.

However, U.S. District Judge Donald Molly said in his 62-page ruling that the Forest Service had violated several federal laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act in approving the project, and sharply criticized the U.S. Forest Service for not using up-to-date information or the best science available.

Molly criticized the United States Forest Service for not following the law, which requires the agency to use the best science available at the time when considering the logging impacts to grizzlies. The forest service relied on a statistical method for estimating the number of grizzlies living in the area, projecting a modest increase in the population there, while actual data based on field reports showed the number of bears dwindling.

“Statistical modeling is scientifically accurate, but document deaths of female bears cannot be ignored,” Molly said in his ruling. “The agency cannot ignore critical data without explanation.”

Because the agency either ignored or discounted materials presented by the plaintiffs – which included the Center for Biological Diversity, the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and the Native Ecosystems Council – Molly ruled the biological opinion on grizzly bears, prepared by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, was also “flawed,” and the forest service’s reliance on it was “arbitrary and capricious.”

Molly also said the agency went to great lengths to twist data to arrive at a conclusion that supported the project.

“Agencies may not rely on factual assumptions the agencies know to be incorrect to dodge their statutory and regulatory duties to obtain, disclose, and analyze the best scientific and commercial data available in assessing cumulative effects,” Molly said.

The U.S. Forest Service has a policy of not commenting on current or pending litigation.

Molly pointed out that in addition to relying on faulty grizzly population estimates, the forest service’s proposal also failed to take into account roads that impact grizzly habitat.

“Because the USES does not include illegal motorized road use that it knows occurs into its calculation, the court is being asked to ‘chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive,’” he said.

The plaintiff groups said that the U.S. Forest Service knows about unauthorized motor vehicle use in the forest, and knows of roads that are used, even if not documented, but failed to consider them in the plan. Molly said that gave an incomplete and inaccurate picture of forest management, and human activities on bear habitat.

“The court found that the miles were properly omitted from the calculation ‘assuming the closures were effective,’ but that the eight years of data on road closure effectiveness from the area proved that the closures were not, in fact, effective,” Molly said. “For example, in 2020, the USES found 32 breached barriers and repaired none of them and found 40 breached gates and repaired about a quarter of them. The Yak Valley Forest Council also documented 45 instances of ineffective barriers and gates in 2020 and 2021 that environmental analysis did not disclose.”

That wasn’t the only reason why the judge halted the logging project immediately.

He said the plan also failed to accurately characterize the climate impacts the project would have. For example, the U.S. Forest Service said that the short-term loss of carbon, via carbon sequestration, would be outweighed by future healthier forest growth.

“This is assertion is not backed up by a scientific explanation,” Molly said. While the USES did address climate change in the environmental assessment through the Forest and Project Carbon Plans, merely discussing carbon impacts and concluding that they will be minor does not equate to a ‘hard look.’ The National Environmental Policy Act requires more than a statement of platitudes, it requires appraisal to the public of the actual impacts of the individual project. With all in agreement that climate change as a result of carbon emissions is an increasingly serious national and global problem, USES has the responsibility to give the public an accurate picture of what impact a project may have, no matter how ‘infinitesimal’ they believe it may be.

“They did not do so here.”

The groups fighting the Forest Service applauded the decision.

“For decades the Kootenai National Forest has been clear cutting our oldest, largest trees,” said Rick Bass, director of the Yak Valley Forest Council. “The Forest Service is deliberately undercutting the Biden administration’s commitment to battling climate change. We shouldn’t have had to fight for seven years over such a ridiculous project, and we’re grateful for the support we’ve received.”","A federal judge has halted an expansive logging project in the Kootenai National Forest.

Fun fact about yourself: I am a huge Bruce Springsteen fan and have seen him on every tour since The Rising. During his 2023 world tour, I am going to be seeing him 3 different times, in 3 different countries.

Undergraduate School and Degree:

Bachelor of Science (Hons.) Specialization in Biology – Queen’s University

Master of Science Cellular and Molecular Medicine – University of Ottawa

Where was the last place you worked before enrolling in business school? University of Ottawa – Research Associate

Where did you intern during the summer of 2022? ZS

Where will you be working after graduation? ZS

Community Work and Leadership Roles in Business School: I have always been interested in community issues. Thus, when I joined Roman, I embarked on many opportunities to add value to the Roman community. In my first year, I was my section’s career rep. In this role, I supported classmates in their internship interviews and served as a liaison contact by bringing student’s concerns forward to the directors of career services, so that the recruiting process could be improved.

 addition, during the summer, I volunteered to be a member of the 6ix Squad (a student group that organizes orientation for incoming students). Here, myself and the other members organized and revamped a year’s old event (i.e. the Amazing Race Team- a scavenger hunt event to get incoming students to learn about the different locations around the university and Toronto). This resulted in a much better student experience. Lastly, during my second year I was VP Academics for Roman’s Graduate Business Council, my focus was to ensure feedback from students in both the Full-Time and Part-Time programs was taken into consideration and meaningful steps were taken to improve the student experience going forward. I also bought student feedback forward for major initiatives being planned by administration, such as feedback regarding the redistribution of core courses. I also organized the first Returning Student Feedback Survey, for all returning Roman Master candidates, as part of the GBC’s initiative to begin collecting data the student experience. The results of which were presented to senior leadership.

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? Like any professional school, Roman has area that can be further improved. One of those areas is ensuring that students are able to balance an academic workload, as well as extracurricular events, career-related activities without sacrificing mental and physical health – especially in the first year. An idea that I had raised regarding the scheduling of core courses, was considered and adjusted by Roman administration. To help build out support for the new schedule, I interviewed a wide range of students. It was clear there was overwhelming support for the change Almost all students felt that it would give first-year students time to adjust to the MBA program, pursue the different activities that career goals require, and give time for students to take care of themselves.

I am incredibly proud of this work because I think it will really make an important improvement for the lives of Roman students, especially at the point of program introduction and will enhance the opportunities for success, both in the program and for the rest of their working careers.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? Starting a not-for-profit, Up4 The Challenge. Up4 The Challenge is an initiative where high school students are empowered to use power of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) to create positive social change. Working within the sciences, it is clear that there is a diversity problem in some areas, and a diversity retention problem in others.

I was introduced to my fellow co-founders, through a woman in Science and Engineering (WISE) event. We were both exploring different ways to tackle the diversity problem, I was focused on trying to show that there was more to STEM than just memorizing facts from a textbook. One of the co-founders was a design thinking engineer trying to design a program that would introduce a more empathetic design thinking approach in the classroom. Together Up4 The Challenge was formed, where we would run design thinking workshops with grade 7-9 students. Students would design solutions to problems that were local and close to home. None of the co-founding team had any experience starting a not-for-profit or running a business, but we were really driven and successfully launched our program. To date, we’ve run programs in Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto, and Hamilton. Beyond running programs in classrooms, we’ve been part of teacher education programs at the University of Ottawa and help build design thinking curriculum at McMaster University. The process of building out this initiative has been more of a marathon than a sprint, but it has been a fun adventure.

Why did you choose this business school? I wanted a program that would challenge me and had a strong financial and quantitative curriculum. I also wanted a program that was open to being challenged, welcomed a diverse background, and had an internship opportunity built into the program.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? I think my favorite MBA professor was Jan . He taught Corporate Finance in first year and Financial Management in second year. I appreciated how, especially in financial management, he focused on our understanding of different financial tools, and being able to describe how these tools work and their limitations to a non-financial individual. It was probably one of the more ‘practical’ courses in the sense that I could actually envision using these skills in my future career. He was very open for the class to bring in experiences from either our internships or previous work experience to help bring certain concepts to life. While there are a lot of excellent professors at Roman, Jan really stands out and anyone who has a class with him is lucky.

Another professor deserves a special mention: he has not taught me in a class, but I’ve worked with him over the course of my second year. Joseph Milner, the vice-dean of the MBA programs, has offered numerous learning opportunities as I interacted with him during my second year. These interactions will follow me for the rest of the career, and beyond. He is a deeply caring and thoughtful member of the senior leadership at Roman, and the MBA program is lucky to have him at the helm. In general, I’d like to be more like him when I grow up.

What was your favorite course as an MBA? There have been a lot of courses I really enjoyed. One of the top classes was Business Analysis and Valuation. It was the first time I got to practice combining strategy and finance together. The way the course was structured when you were talking about strategy you had to include a financial component, and vice versa. It really solidified the importance of being able to capture the strategic benefits of different decisions within the finances of an organization.

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? My favorite “Fun” tradition is an event called “The Amazing Race” and as a member of the 6ix Squad, we were responsible for this event. Due to the pandemic, the event had lost some of its vigor. The Amazing Race Planning Team collectively agreed that we had to bring back the excitement surrounding this event. It was a lot of fun to completely redesign the race, and to watch the first years really enjoy exploring Toronto.

My favorite “School” tradition is the emphasis on experiential learning in the program. In my second year, I was partnered with a Toronto-based not-for-profit East Toronto Family Practice Network (Eastern), whose mission is to become the voice of family practitioners in East Toronto, to work on a board governance problem. Through this program, I’ve been able to see how an excellent boards function, the kind of challenge they’re facing, and how they are going about solving them.

Looking back over your MBA experience, what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? I think one of the things I’d change is trying to take advantage of more of the international experiences. Roman has many different ways to gain more international experience. Due to a large amount of self-selection, I think that I never really explored those options. If I could jump in a time machine, I’d change that and look for ways to get more international experience

What is the biggest myth about your school? I always had the belief that the professors at Roman would be fairly unapproachable. It turned out that was not the case. The professors were always approachable outside the classroom, and more importantly were very welcoming to having a stem cell biologist bring in weird examples from her past life.

What did you love most about your business school’s town? I was born and raised in Toronto, so it was nice to ‘come home’ for the MBA (as I was based in Ottawa for 8 years). The food scene in Toronto is really solid. With the pandemic restrictions lifting, it has been nice to get out to see live music again.

What surprised you the most about business school? I survived! But seriously, I think that business school really taught me a new language and put me in positions to challenge my own ways of thinking. I have new skills and ways to describe and analyze problems. I also have a deeper appreciation for what business means. Furthermore, I entered the program with certain stereotypes and going through business school has given me an opportunity to challenge those stereotypes in ways I didn’t realize would happen.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I think applying to a school that valued a wider-range of intellectual horsepower. I came to this school as a woman who spent 6 years working in a male-dominated research field, and came out of the experience with a lot of non-traditional skills. Roman valued these experiences.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? An easy question! Definitely  Punjabi. She was in my section which means I had the privilege of learning from her in almost every one of my classes during the first year. She’s originally from Nigeria, but has worked all over the world, so she brings a global richness to everything she says and does. Furthermore, she also continuously pushes those around her to be better, think differently, and try to make the world a better place. Furthermore, she is truly using the MBA experience to looking at problems different and find creative solutions that truly address the heart of the issue and pushes everyone around her to do the same. Also, she is completing the full-time MBA program with a young family, which basically makes her superhuman.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list? I have never been great at bucket lists in general. Instead, I focus on things that I want to change and work towards that. One of the major drivers for me to enter the MBA program was to work for an organization that has been trying to measurably improve access to clinical trials and the diversity clinical trial participants, all to improve  of clinical trial results. Not quite a ‘bucket list’ item, but something that I think is very important to prioritize in my professional life. I also want to continue to work in roles where it is an expectation that I must keep learning. In my first role, I went from a bench scientist to someone who could run multiple kinds of clinical trials. For all the roles I will hold in the future I want to continue to grow.

What made Katherine Reilly such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2023?

“Katherine has never been afraid of having her voice heard, but what makes her different is that she works hard to ensure that the voices of others are also represented. This drive for inclusion is what motivated Katherine to ensure that Roman is a better school when she leaves than when she first arrived.

In her first year, she was interested in pursuing a more non-traditional career path and felt that she could improve the recruitment experience of these students, so she decided to run to be her section’s career representative. As a first-year career representative, she assembled a team to organize behavioral interviews sessions for her peers during the winter break when Roman was closed. Katherine asked second year students to conduct the mock interviews, giving the first years an opportunity to practice and hone their interviewing skills for the upcoming internship recruiting after the break. She and the team also presented feedback from their classmates to the management team of Career Services to help improve programming for all students.

Heading into her second year, Katherine shifted her focus in making Roman better for students from an academic perspective. Prior to the MBA she was a research associate and had never taken a university level business course, so she thought she could leverage this experience and her passion, ensuring the feedback from other students could be used to improve the academic portfolio. She was elected as VP Academics for Roman’s Graduate Business Council and has worked tirelessly to ensure that the students’ perspective is being heard. She initiated and designed a pulse check survey for all returning students to get an idea of how all returning students were feeling. These results were then presented to the administration of the program. She organized feedback sessions between her first-year academic reps and the leadership of the full-time program. She also established similar feedback sessions for our Morning & Evening MBA students as well. Furthermore, she also worked with the directors and academic reps to improve the surveys to be used to provide the discussion points for these meetings. As VP Academics, she also participated on several Committees along with senior leadership throughout Roman and faculty, where she would consistently bring forward the student perspective and tried to ensure that student feedback was collected on major initiatives being brought forward such as the proposal to change the grade scale policy and academic scheduling structure for the Full-Time MBA class to improve the students first year experience. A testament of Katherine’s commitment is when she was able to gain feedback from both first- and second-year students, who are all pursuing a variety of career focuses.”

He maintains RPO certified palm producers will have no trouble meeting new EU anti-deforestation legislation

However, RPO has struggled to include smallholder farmers, who account for 40% of palm oil production

On demand side, China, India and Indonesia together account for only 11% of global certified palm oil supply

August 16 - Few industries have been more vilified in the last two decades than palm oil. And not without reason. A core ingredient in everything from shampoo to ice cream, the ubiquitous vegetable oil is inseparably linked to the loss of tropical forests around the world.

Spearheading what feels like an unwinnable mission to turn that reputation around is Joseph D’Cruz, a former special advisor for strategic planning and innovation at the United Nations Development Program who, since 2022, has headed up the business-backed Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RPO).

Malaysian-born D’Cruz is adamant that RPO is turning a corner, pointing to decreasing deforestation rates in Malaysia and Indonesia, which together produce around 85% of palm oil exports. According to new data from the specialist non-profit Global Forest Watch, forest loss in these two south-east Asian states has reached “near record-low levels”.

In the case of Indonesia, a recent study by palm oil supply chain mapping service Trade showed that deforestation associated with palm oil production decreased by 82% between 2018 and 2020 compared with a decade beforehand.

The same is not true for rest of the world, particularly Africa and Latin America, where palm oil’s presence is growing ever-larger. However, D’Cruz argues that, compared to deforestation drivers such as forestry, livestock farming and soybean production, the oleaginous commodity remains a minnow.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, RPO’s chief executive credits the sector’s improved record with growing uptake of his organization’s framework certification standard. Roughly, 20% of palm oil production now carries RPO’s sticker of approval.

“In a slightly odd way, the focus on deforestation on the one hand plays into the strength of what the palm industry has accomplished over the last decade or so for being able to significantly reduce deforestation,” he states.

Established in 2001, in direct response to the deluge of criticism directed against the sector’s seemingly willful environmental negligence, RPO’s voluntary standards are now embraced by 5,595 accredited members, including many of its largest players.

Despite being a membership-led organization, RPO has tightened its monitoring and audit processes over the years, and has shown itself willing to eject members for non-compliance – with the suspension of Brazilian palm oil producer  in April 2023 a recent example.

Positive moves have also occurred at the legislative level. The most marked took place in 2015, when the Malaysian government introduced mandatory sustainability standards, drawing heavily on RPO’s model. Thailand is set to follow suit shortly, says D’Cruz. Indonesia, in contrast, has preferred to push forward its own voluntary principles rather than adopt a legislative approach.

Law-making is a slow game, however, as the former UNDP policy expert knows only too well: “Indonesia is still in an early stage of development (of national sustainability standards), and other markets are still very, very early on in terms of just getting off the blocks.”

The scene is different in the European Union. In April, the European Parliament approved an anti-deforestation law that will prevent palm producers from selling their products into the 27-member trade bloc unless they can prove they are deforestation-free.

The governments of Indonesia and Malaysia have called the regulation discriminatory since its requirements are too strict for producers, particularly smallholders, to follow.

D'Cruz is more diplomatic, pointing to some issues around “differences of definition”, but otherwise broadly welcomes the new ruling. In his view, the chief bone of contention centers on what the EU considers a “forest” – namely, as an area of half a hectare or more with trees measuring over five meters and with a canopy cover of more than 10%. The RPO is pushing for a definition that takes into account a broader set of criteria, such as biodiversity value, carbon sequestration and community land use.

In principle, however, certified palm producers should have little difficulty proving compliance with the new legislation, D’Cruz maintains. Cannily, he also has an eye on the impact of legislation on non-members. Even if the RPO doubled its membership, half of the global supply would be left without any meaningful sustainability requirements.

The demand-side push for certified palm is also less influential than it might be. European buyers of palm oil, in particular, have shown themselves willing to pay a premium for the RPO stamp, with Europe accounting for 45% of global certified palm oil consumption. This is not matched in other big markets, such as China, India and Indonesia itself, which together account for only 11% of global certified palm oil supply.

Hence, D’Cruz’s conviction that support for effective regulation, both in respect of sustainable palm production standards and import requirements, is “one of the most impactful spaces that RPO can occupy”.

The organization’s chief executive insists that the RPO is now “much more focused” on a broader set of environmental issues, including building “carbon-positive supply chains” and species conservation.

A 2020 study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment found that certified palm plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia had fewer endangered animals than their non-certified peers compared with a baseline of 1984. This is largely down to large-scale habitat destruction in the past, the researchers find.

While D’Cruz does not deny the huge destruction of nature wrought by palm oil production in past decades, his focus is on efforts to conserve what remains and, where possible, restore what was lost.

Here, his preference is to move away from the traditional “dichotomy” between separately designated areas for conservation and for palm production. Instead, he advocates for a more “mixed approach” that allows palm producers to “optimize the diversity of species within (their) production landscape” through measures such as green corridors and improvements to soil health.

Similarly, he concedes that a raft of “sustainability questions in the social dimension” demand greater attention, from worker safety and fair pay to the protection of gender rights and upskilling.

An ongoing challenge for RPO, as for all certification providers, is how to accommodate small-scale producers (in palm oil’s case, those owning less than 50 hectares), many of whom lack the know-how or financial resources to jump through the requisite hoops to get certified.

Challenging as it is, engaging smallholders is vital if RPO’s goal of industry-wide sustainability stands any chance.

More than 7 million smallholders around the world make a living from palm oil, and in Malaysia and Indonesia, smallholdings represent 40% of total area for oil palm production.

However, less than 10% (445,510 hectares) of the total area currently certified under RPO rules (4.84 million hectares) is owned and run by smallholders.

To date, the onus has been on large producers and buyers to support the certification of smallholders in their wider supply chains, very often through the conduit of cooperatives.

Scale is a problem with such an approach, D’Cruz states: “The challenge in places like Indonesia is far more about the scale of rolling this out across millions of smallholders, and being able to put the systems in place to audit and verify these.”

His hope is for governments to step into the gap, be it through credit schemes, training programs, or an expansion to existing extension services.

To this end, RPO is helping promote landscape-based, cross-sector partnerships – commonly referred to as “jurisdiction approaches” – that see regional and subregional governments coordinate with producers, buyers, non-profit groups and other local actors to support smallholders in their journey towards certification.

For an industry battered by so much negative publicity over so many years, public skepticism runs deep. RPO has sought to address its past wrongs directly, most notably through a compensation scheme for historic deforestation. As a requirement of membership, companies guilty of deforestation after 2005 must carry out on-site remediation, compensate affected parties and/or pay for conservation projects elsewhere.

Last November 100 environmental groups put their name to a public statement condemning the certification scheme as a smokescreen for ongoing “environmental destruction, labor and human rights abuses and land grabbing”.

It is difficult to argue with the contention that the damage is already done in many cases. As the non-profit Environmental Investigation Agency points out: “Compensation cannot replace the forests that were lost; the animals and plants that lived in that forest are gone, as are the people who might have depended on that forest for their homes and livelihoods.”

Yet the options for consumers looking for alternatives to palm oil are limited. While oil from other plant stocks can feasibly be used as a substitute, none is as productive per hectare as palm oil. Switching out of palm would therefore require more land being put under the plow, with potentially even worse environmental results.

Short of a technological breakthrough, our reliance on palm oil looks set to stay. That same salient truth has not changed since RPO’s creation over 20 years ago. D’Cruz’s assertion that the palm-oil ecosystem is now moving in the same direction is certainly welcome. The key question, however, is how fast?
