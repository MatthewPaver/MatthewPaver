# 💫 About Me

🎓 I recently completed my **BSc in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence** from the University of Liverpool and now work as a **Solutions Architect**.  
<br>
⚙️ I design and deliver systems that connect data, automate workflows, and surface insight — from knowledge graphs and AI assistants to automation frameworks.  
<br>
🤖 My current work focuses on:  
- **Knowledge graph systems** for project insight and reasoning  
- **Automation and data integration** using tools like n8n, Supabase, and Azure  
- **AI-driven applications** powered by LangChain, GraphRAG, and vector search  

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on:
- Applied **AI and automation** projects  
- **Data and systems integration** tools  
- Open-source initiatives that make intelligent systems more accessible  

🌱 Currently learning about:
- Advanced orchestration and deployment techniques  
- **RAG pipelines** and scalable vector databases  
- Intelligent agents using **LangChain**, **AutoGen**, and other frameworks  

💬 Ask me about:
- Building connected, data-rich platforms  
- Automating workflows for teams and SMEs  
- Integrating AI tools into real-world systems
