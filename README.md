# 💫 About Me

I build practical AI systems that connect data, automate work, and surface insight. My projects usually sit where data engineering, applied machine learning, and product thinking meet. I like working on things that actually ship and fix a real problem.

## What I work on
- Retrieval and reasoning pipelines using Python, LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom RAG setups, and vector search  
- Knowledge graph systems in Neo4j and Cypher to capture structure, context, and relationships  
- LLM powered agents and evaluation frameworks for search, classification, routing, and decision workflows  
- Data automation using Supabase, n8n, Azure Functions, Playwright scrapers, and lightweight orchestration

## What I enjoy building
- Event scraping and enrichment pipelines  
- AI assistants for structured tasks  
- Ranking or recommendation systems  
- Tools that help people understand data without fighting it  

## Recent work
- London event discovery pipeline with Firecrawl and Playwright  
- Graph based RAG experiments combining Neo4j and local LLMs  
- A general agent evaluation framework using structured prompts and metrics  
- Applied ML tasks like similarity ranking, sentence embedding search, and user recommendation modelling  

## What I am looking for
Roles where I can work across data, machine learning, and systems. I enjoy the modelling work, but I also enjoy the glue logic, the evaluation loops, and the engineering that sits around them.
